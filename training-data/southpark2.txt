         STAN
I'm going to the movies
To see the brighter side of life!
I'm going to the movie
Everything's gonna be alright!
Forget all my troubles
Put my own life on hold
Let a studio tell me
how I should view the world
Where everything works out
I love it that way
I'm going to the movies
The movies today!

Stan merrily walks up to a crappy looking house.

INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

We are in a young boy's bedroom, just as his alarm clock goes
off. BRRRRRTTT!!!

         RADIO ANNOUNCER
Good morning South Park! It's five-thirty
a.m. on Sunday!! Time to feed the horses
and water the cows!!

From the back, we see the blond haired kid sit up from his
bed. He stretches, and then walks over to his closet.

We still only see the boy from the back as he reaches in his
closet and pulls out an orange coat.

The kid puts his coat on, then turns to camera and pulls the
hood shut, so that we never get a good look at his face.

         MOTHER (O.S.)
KENNY! YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR CHURCH!!!

This boy's name is KENNY, and under his orange coat, we have
no idea what he looks like, except for his European nose and
hazel eyes.

                     KENNY
           Mph rmph rm!

INT. KENNY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN

Kenny walks through his small, dirty house and into the
kitchen, where his MOTHER, FATHER and OLDER BROTHER are
sitting at the humble table.

                     KENNY'S MOTHER
           Sit down, you can share some of your
           brother's waffle.

The doorbell rings. Kenny walks over to the door.

EXT. KENNY'S HOUSE - DAY

Kenny opens the door to find Stan.

                     STAN
           Kenny! The Terrance and Phillip movie is
           out! You wanna come?!

Stan shows Kenny a newspaper clipping. It's an ad for the new
Terrance and Phillip movie 'Asses of fire'. Kenny's eyes
light up.

                     KENNY
           Mph rmph rm, rmph!

Kenny walks away with Stan. His mother comes out after him.

                     KENNY'S MOTHER
           Kenny! Where're you going?

                     KENNY
           Mph mprh mprh rm!

                     KENNY'S MOTHER
           What do you mean you don't want to go to
           church?

                     KENNY
           Mrmph, rmph rmph rm rmph.

Kenny and Stan walk down the street.

                     KENNY'S MOTHER
           Well fine, go ahead and miss church!! And
           then when you die and go to hell you can
           ANSWER TO SATAN!!

Dramatic MUSIC STING. Kenny stops, thinks for a minute... And
then walks off with Stan anyway.

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY

Stan and Kenny now both happily march down the street to the
happy beat.

TOM, a plastic surgeon, peeps his head out the door of his
Rhinoplasty office.

                     TOM
           Say, where are you boys going?

                     STAN
           We're going to the movies!
           To see the brighter side of life!
           Where everyone is beautiful
           And have their hair combed just
           right!

                     KENNY
           Mph rmph rm rmph rm!
           Mph rm rmph rm!
           Mprh rm rmph rm rm
           Rmph rm rmph rm rmph!

                     TOM
           Have fun you rascals!

EXT. KYLE'S HOUSE - DAY

Kenny and Stan knock at the door.

A handsome eight year old Semite, KYLE, answers the door.

                     KYLE
           Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go
           to church, Kenny?

                     STAN
           Kyle, check it out.

Kenny holds up the newspaper clipping.

                     KYLE
           OH MY GOD, DUDE!!!

Kyle slips on his coat and heads out the door. But just then,
Kyle's little brother, IKE, a two year old adopted Canadian
boy bounces up next to him.

                     KYLE
           No, Ike! You can't come with me!

Kyle's MOTHER, a big fat bitch, comes to the door and yells.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Kyle, you take your little brother out to
           play with you!

                     KYLE
           Aw, ma!!

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Do as I say, Kyle!

Kyle's mother closes the door.

                     KYLE
           Damn it!!

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY

Now the three boys, and little Ike, merrily strut down the
street and sing in unison.

                     BOYS
           We're going to the movies
           To see the better side of life
           Where something interesting happens
           Every day and night!

                     KYLE
           In movies we can pretend
           That love is real
           and good always wins-

                     STAN
           We can even make believe marriages
           last!

A HOMELESS guy is lying in the alley.

                     HOMELESS GUY
           Spare a dollar? Spare a dollar?

Stan walks by and throws a dollar at him. The homeless guy
suddenly jumps up.

                     HOMELESS GUY
           I'm going to the movies!
           To see the brighter side of life!
           I'm going to the movies
           Everything's gonna be alright!
           Forget my troubles
           Put my own life on hold
           Let a studio tell me
           how to view the world!

                     KYLE
           Let's go get fat ass!

EXT. ANOTHER HOUSE - DAY

This house looks just like all the others.

INT. THAT SAME HOUSE

CLOSE UP on a bag that reads 'CHEESY POOFS'. A hand reaches
into the bag, pulls out a wad of orange crunchies and raises
them --

BOOM UP to reveal the fat face of eight year old ERIC CARTMAN
who chows down on the chips.

Now we see that fat little Eric is sitting on his couch,
eating Cheesy Poofs and watching television.

The doorbell rings. Cartman doesn't move a muscle.

                     CARTMAN
           MOM! SOMEBODY'S AT THE DOOR!

CARTMAN'S MOTHER enters. She is extremely June Cleaveresque
(except that she's a hermaphrodite crack whore). She returns
with Stan, Kyle and Kenny.

                     CARTMAN'S MOTHER
           Look, Eric it's your little friends.

                     CARTMAN
           What the hell are you guys doing here?

                     IKE
           Baba turtre bad!

Kyle holds up the newspaper ad.

                     CARTMAN
           Ooh!

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE

Now all four boys are merrily walking down the street and
singing.

                     BOYS
           We're going to the movies
           To see the better side of life!

                     CARTMAN
           Maybe there'll be pirates!
           Or a whole city burnin'!
           Maybe we'll see a monster
           Or, better yet, Uma Thurman!

                     BOYS
           We're going to the movies!
           Everything's gonna be okay!

The boys skip out of frame.

EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY

The movie theatre is nestled neatly between two other South
Park buildings.

The boys walk up to the geeky, teenage TICKET GUY.

                     BOYS
           Going to the movies!
           The movies today!!!!!

                     STAN
           Can I get five tickets to Terrance and
           Phillip Asses of Fire, please?

                     TICKET GUY
           No.

Suddenly, all the happy music that has permeated the film
comes to an ABRUPT HALT.

The boys look confused.

                     KYLE
           What'dya mean, no?

                     TICKET GUY
           Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire is
           rated 'R'. You kids can't get in.

The boys look shocked. They just stand there, in silence.

                     CARTMAN
           The hell we can't! My money is just as
           good as any white person's!

                     TICKET GUY
           You have to be accompanied by a parent or
           guardian.

                     KYLE
           But why?

                     TICKET GUY
           Because this movie has naughty language,
           and it might make you kids start using
           bad words.

                     CARTMAN
           Listen you son of a bitch, if you don't
           let us in to see this movie I'm gonna
           kick you square in the nuts.

                     TICKET GUY
           Sorry, Charlie.

                     KYLE
           Damn it!

                     TICKET GUY
           Next, please?

A few TEENAGERS walk up to get their tickets. The boys step
aside.

                     STAN
           This is terrible! This can't be
           happening!!

                     KYLE
           We HAVE to see this movie, dude!

                     CARTMAN
           Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that
           good anyway.

                     KYLE
           Cartman! What the hell are you talking
           about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!

                     CARTMAN
           Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it
           probably can't sustain itself over ninety
           minutes.

                     IKE
           Poo baba!

                     STAN
           Wait! I've got an idea!

EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - A LITTLE LATER

The old Homeless guy from the intro song walks up to the
Ticket Guy with the boys.

                     HOMELESS GUY
           Uh, hi. I want five tickets to Terrance
           and Phillip Asses of Fire.

                     TICKET GUY
           You realize this movie is rated R? It may
           not be appropriate for your little ones.

                     HOMELESS GUY
           Oh.
               (Turning to boys)
           Hey, he says this movie isn't appropriate
           for you.

                     STAN
               (Whispering)
           Look, homeless guy, if you don't want to
           buy us tickets, and NOT get your ten
           bucks and NOT go buy yourself a bottle of
           Vodka and not forget about how miserable
           your life is and not stop the voices in
           your head then go right ahead.

                     HOMELESS GUY
           Five tickets please.

The Ticket guy suspiciously hands them over.

INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

The boys are all sitting in the front row. Cartman has a huge
tub of popcorn, all kinds of candy, and a large drink.

                     IKE
           Purpre mama!

                     KYLE
           Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting!

ANGLE - MOVIE SCREEN

A TITLE reads 'Terrance and Phillip - Asses of Fire'

                     BOYS
           HOORAY!!!

On the screen, we come across PHILLIP, a very handsome
Canadian star with a great body.

                     PHILLIP
           Say Terrance, what did the Spanish Priest
           say to the Uranian gynecologist?

PAN OVER to TERRANCE, who is also Canadian, and equally
handsome in a more rugged way.

                     TERRANCE
           I don't know, Phillip, what?

Phillip rips a big fart. Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

ANGLE - BOYS

Laughing their asses off.

                     KYLE
           That was sweet!

                     STAN
           Where do they come up with this stuff?!

                     CARTMAN
           How come Terrance and Phillip are so
           weird looking?

                     KYLE
           Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like
           Ike!

                     CARTMAN
           Oh.

                     IKE
           Poo bada!

ANGLE - SCREEN

                     TERRANCE
           You're such a pigfucker, Phillip!

                     PHILLIP
           What?! Why would you call me a
           pigfucker?!

                     TERRANCE
           Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck
           pigs.

                     PHILLIP
           Oh yeah!

Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

ANGLE - BOYS

                     KYLE
           Woa, dude! Did they say what I think they
           said?

ANGLE - SCREEN

Terrance pulls out a white envelope.

                     TERRANCE
           Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I
           just got a letter!

                     PHILLIP
           A letter from who, you shit sucking cock
           master?

TRACK IN on the boys' wide eyed faces as the dialogue from
the film enters their innocent ears.

                     TERRANCE
           It's from your mother.

                     PHILLIP
           My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it
           say?

                     TERRANCE
           It says 'Dear Terrance, please don't ever
           tell my son that I licked your hairy
           balls.'

Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

                     PHILLIP
           Oh, you fucking ball whore!

The boys don't laugh, they just smile widely, they seem busy
taking it all in.

                     CARTMAN
           Wow... Ball whore...

                     TERRANCE
           Listen, you donkey raping shit eater-

                     KYLE

                     TERRANCE & PHILLIP
           Unclefucka!  That's YOUUUUUUU!!!!!

The song ends and the boys erupt into applause.

EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY

The boys walk out of the theatre with glazed eyes and wide
smiles.

                     KYLE
           Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!

                     CARTMAN

                     STAN

           guardian?

                     STAN
           Huh?

                     TICKET GUY
           I knew it! You PAID a homeless guy to get
           you in, didn't you!

The boys think a second.

                     CARTMAN
           Suck my balls.

                     KYLE

               (Singing)
           Shut your fucking face,
           Unclefucka!!

The boys walk away, merrily. The ticket guy is in shock.

                     TICKET GUY
           Oh oh, I'm in trouble.

                     BOYS
               (Singing, fading off)
           You're an asslicking, ball sucking
           Unclefucka!!

EXT. STARK'S POND - DAY

All the children of South Park are gathered at the pond for
ice skating.

The scene is reminiscent of the skating scene from the
Charlie Brown Christmas special.

Delicate snowflakes fall, children laugh and skate, and
joyous music plays.

The boys walk up to the pond.

                     CLYDE
           Hey, where have you guys been all day?

                     STAN
           Oh, nowhere... We just went out to go see
           the TERRANCE AND PHILLIP MOVIE!

All the kids gasp! Dramatic MUSIC STING.

                     BEBE
           You saw it?!

                     CLYDE
           How'd you get in?!

Suddenly, all the kids are gathered around the boys. They're
like celebrities.

                     CARTMAN
           Hey! Stop crowding us you shitfaced
           cockmasters!

All the kids stop, wide eyed. As if they've just hear the
voice of God.

                     KIDS
           Wowwww...

                     STAN
           Yeah, you're all a bunch of ass ramming
           unclefuckers.

                     KIDS
           Ooooohhh!!!

                     CLYDE
                (To another kid)
           We HAVE to see this movie, dude.

The other kids nod.

                     CARTMAN
           Hey Stan, tell 'em about when Terrance
           called Phillip a testicle shitting rectal
           wart! Stan? Stan?

But Stan is elsewhere, because out on the ice, skating
gracefully, is little eight year old WENDY TESTABURGER.

The heavens part, a CHOIR OF ANGELS sing, as Wendy skates
around and around, performing a series of impossible Triple
Lutzes, Sowcows and what-have-you-not's.

All the animals of the forest -- deer, birds, bunnies -- all
stop to admire her.

Stan's smile grows wider and wider. Kyle turns to see what
he's looking at.

                     STAN
           Thank my lucky stars
           Here before me now
           Is everything I'd ever hoped for
           Knew it in a word
           Saw it in a glance
           The only thing I think I'd die
           for...

                     KYLE
           Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that
           fucking song again.

ANGLE - WENDY

Spinning and soaring in slo-mo.  Effortlessly covering every
inch of the pond with her ballet maneuvers.

Stan is slack-jawed.

                     STAN
           I can't stop now
           My heart's awake
           I pray her arms
           my arms to take
           So this is why I'm ali-

Wendy finishes her routine with a triumphant Hamill-camel
landing right in front of Stan and spraying ice in his face
and abruptly ending his song.

                     WENDY
           Hi, Stan!

Stan vomits profusely all over himself.

                     WENDY
           Ew! Gross!

Just then, another kid skates up, spraying more ice in Stan's
face. His name is GREGORY, and he is a very handsome eight
year old boy, with golden hair and an open-buttoned shirt. He
speaks with a rich English accent.

                     GREGORY
           Come, Wendy, let us try to jump the hilly
           brush.

Stan looks at Gregory.

                     STAN
           Who are you, kid?

                     GREGORY
           My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's
           counter-cousin for some time.

                     WENDY
           Want to skate with us?

                     GREGORY
           We've been skating all morning. And
           laughing and talking of memories past.

Gregory skates away. Stan looks stunned. Finally, he tries to
get Wendy's attention.

                     STAN
           We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!

                     WENDY
           That's nice, Stan.

Wendy skates after Gregory. Stan looks completely rejected.

                     KYLE
           Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new
           guy?

                     STAN
           She's not my girlfriend, dude!

Meanwhile, the schoolkids are all still gathered around
Cartman.

                     CARTMAN
           Yes, I saw the Terrance and Phillip
           movie. Who wants to touch me?  I said,
           "Who wants to touch me?!"

A small boy steps forward and tentatively touches Cartman's
arm.

                     SMALL BOY
           Oooooh...

EXT. SOUTH PARK - TOWN - MORNING

Establishing shot of the little town of South Park which
consists of four buildings. The sun rises in the background.

It's a brand new day.

EXT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY

The elementary school is nestled peacefully between two
mountain peaks.

INT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY

The kids of South Park are all in their seats, singing.

                     KIDS
           Shut your fucking face,
           Unclefucka!!
           You're a shitsucking, cocksucking
           Unclefucka!!

The door opens, and suddenly the kids quiet down.

CLOSE-UP on a hand puppet with a large red hat. It seems to
be speaking.

                     MR. HAT
           Okay, children, let's take our seats.

As the voice continues, we PULL BACK to reveal that the
puppet is on the right hand of MR. GARRISON, a forty-six year
old teacher who is in denial about his homosexuality.

                     MR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT)
           We have a lot to learn and precious
           little time.

Garrison looks over the class and notices that every single
one of them is wearing a Terrance and Phillip T-shirt,
except, of course, for Wendy.

                     MR. GARRISON
           Why is everyone wearing T-shirts of
           Sigfried and Roy?

                     KYLE
           It's not Sigried and Roy, Mr. Garrison,
           it's Terrance and Phillip.

                     KIDS
           TERRANCE AND PHILLIP!!

Stan looks over at Wendy. She just rolls her eyes. Stan
sulks.

                     MR. GARRISON
           Well, anyway... Today children, our
           friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all
           about the environment.

                     MR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT)
           That's right, Mr. Garrison. The
           environment is what surrounds us. It is
           what we live and breathe.

                     CARTMAN
           I hate the environment.

                     KYLE
           Dude, how can you hate the environment?

                     CARTMAN
           'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and
           fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.

The kids all GASP!

                     MR. GARRISON
           Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?

                     CARTMAN
           Fragile?

                     KYLE
           No, he's talking about fuck, dude. You
           can't say fuck in front of Mr. Garrison.

                     MR. GARRISON
           Kyle!

                     CARTMAN
           Why the fuck not?

                     MR. GARRISON
           Eric!

                     STAN
           Dude, you just said fuck again.

                     MR. GARRISON
           Stanly!

                     KENNY
           Mph.

                     MR. GARRISON
           Kenny!

                     CARTMAN
           That's bullshit! If Terrance and Phillip
           can say something, I should be able to
           say it too!

                     BEBE
           Wow, Cartman's cool!

                     CLYDE
           He's like Terrance and Phillip!

Cartman gloats proudly.

                     CARTMAN
           Fuckin' a right.

                     MR. GARRISON
           How would you like to go to the
           principal's office?

                     CARTMAN
           How would you like to gargle rat jiz?

Mr. Garrison is in shock.

                     MR. GARRISON
           WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!

                     CARTMAN
           I said -

Cartman takes out a megaphone, hits the switch and puts it
to his mouth. It feeds back horribly.

                     CARTMAN
                (Through megaphone)
           HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO GARGLE RAT JIZ?!

Garrison is floored.

                     KYLE
           Oh, dude we are fucked now.

INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

The boys are seated in front of the Principal's desk.

                     STAN
           Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw
           the Terrance and Phillip movie!

                     KYLE
           Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!

Just then, the Principal walks in. She is PRINCIPAL VICTORIA,
a frizzy haired woman of about forty.

                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
           I am VERY disappointed in you boys!
           You should be ASHAMED of yourselves! I've
           already called in your parents, but first
           I want you to THINK about what you've
           done.

                      CARTMAN
           Principal Victoria, can I ask a question?

                     PRINCPAL VICTORIA
           What?

                     CARTMAN
           What's the big fucking deal?

                     STAN
           Yeah.

                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
           AGH!! I want to know where you heard
           these horrific obscenities!

The boys look at each other.

                     STAN
           Nowhere.

                     KYLE
           I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few
           times before...

                     STAN
           Yeah!

                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
           Boys, I seriously doubt that Mr. Garrison
           ever said-
                (Reading)
           'Eat penguin shit you cum sucking ass
           spelunker' in school!

The boys all laugh.

But then the door opens and in walks Stan's mother, Kyle's
mother, Cartman's mother and Kenny's mother.

                     STAN
           Oh, oh...

                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
           Thank you all for coming on such short
           notice. As you can see, your boys are all
           being disciplined.

                     STAN'S MOTHER
           This just isn't like you, Stanley!

Stan looks down at the floor.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           What did my son say, Principal Victoria?
           Did he say the S word?

                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
           No, it was worse than that...

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                (Gasping)
           The F word?!

                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
           No, worse. Here's a short list of the
           things they've been saying.

The mothers look over the sheet of paper. Immediately, their
eyes bulge.

                     STAN'S MOTHER
           Oh dear God...

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           What is 'fisting'?

                     CARTMAN'S MOTHER
           That's when the fist is inserted into the
           anus or vagina for sexual pleasure.

The two moms stare at Ms. Cartman.

                     CARTMAN'S MOTHER
           What?

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                (To Kyle)
           Young man, you will tell Peincipal
           Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all
           these horrible phrases!

                     KYLE
           I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath,
           and swore ourselves to secrecy!

                     CARTMAN
           It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!

                     STAN
           Dude!

                     CARTMAN
           What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of
           here.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt!
             Not again!

                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
           What is Terrance and Phillip?

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Terrance and Phillip are two VERY
           untalented, unfunny actors from Canada.
           Their TV show is filled with toilet humor
           and bad language and is just complete
           garbage.  Now it appears they have a
           movie and I'm positive it's not suitable
           for children!

                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
           Well, it looks like I'll have to send a
           warning letter out to parents. I have to
           put a stop to this before MORE children
           see 'Terrance and Phillip'.

                     CARTMAN
           Everybody's already fucking seen it.

                     MS. CARTMAN
           Eric!

                     CARTMAN
           I'm sorry! I can't help it!! That movie
           has warped my fragile little mind.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Alright, boys, that's enough. Get out and
           let us adults speak.

The boys get up and walk out. Kyle's mother slams the door
behind them.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           We must take action on this immediately.

                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
           Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give
           detention to those boys.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Forgive me for saying so, Principal
           Victoria, but your methods are too...
           Shall we say... soft?  As head of the
           PTA, I am exercising my right under
           article 42 of the PTA code.

A look of shock comes over the principal's face.

                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
           Article 42!  You don't mean-?!

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is
           impeaching you.

                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
           But I-

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           You are officially relieved of your
           duties as principal of this school!

Kyle's mother sits herself down at Principal Victoria's desk.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Get out of that chair! The PTA is in
           charge now!

INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

The other school kids are in line for lunch.

Just then, the Kyle's mother's voice comes blaring through
the P.A.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Attention students. We are now enforcing
           a new dress code at South Park
           Elementary. Terrance and Phillip shirts
           are NO LONGER ALLOWED IN SCHOOL. Anyone
           wearing a Terrance and Phillip shirt is
           to be SENT HOME IMMEDIATELY.

The kids look down. They're all wearing Terrance and Phillip
shirts.

                     KIDS
           HOOORAY!!!

The kids all cheer and run out the door. Leaving the
cafeteria absolutely empty... Except for Wendy.

                     WENDY
           Hello?

Wendy's hello echoes throughout the entire building.

INT. TELEVISION SET

A dapper NEWS ANCHOR sits behind a news desk.

                     NEWS ANCHOR
           All over America, kids are flocking to
           the R rated film, 'Terrance and Phillip
           Asses of Fire'. Here with a special
           report, is a quadriplegic midget in a
           bikini.

INT. SPELLING BEE - DAY

A QUADRIPLEGIC MIDGET IN A BIKINI stands in front of the
camera with a microphone.

                     Q. MIDGET W/BIKINI
           Thanks, Tom. It appears that the effects
           of the Canadian Comedy are far reaching
           indeed. All over America, children seem
           to be influenced.

 A TEACHER is on stage with a young spelling bee contestant.

                     TEACHER
           Alright, this is for the silver medal.
           Spell 'Forensics'.

                     KID
           Oh, fuck that, why should I fucking have
           to spell forensics?

All the kids cheer.

                     KID
           Here you go; S-U-C-K-M-Y-A-S-S,
           FORENSICS.

                                                      CUT TO:

EXT. BIRTHDAY PARTY - DAY

A happy birthday party is going on is some kids backyard. A
clown is entertaining everyone.

                     CLOWN
           Hey kids, how would you like to see some
           magic tricks?!

                     KIDS
           FUCK YOU!!

The clown looks startled.

                     CLOWN
           Huh?

                     CHILD
           Yeah, and fuck your stupid little red
           nose.

                     CHILD 2
           Yeah, and fuck your yellow hair. And fuck
           your gay pants.

PAN OVER to again find the midget reporter. He now has a
graphic of a record chart next to him.

                     Q. MIDGET W/BIKINI
           And the devastating impact of the
           Canadian phenomenon is Terrance and
           Phillip's new hit song, "Shut Your
           Fucking Face, Unclefucka" which has
           climbed the charts with a bullet --

We see a clip from the video, "Unclefucka."

The video has Terrance and Phillip dressed like Mase and
Puffy in that video they did in Vegas.  They wear shiny
bright jumpsuits and lunge at the fish-eye lens of the
camera.

                     TERRANCE & PHILLIP
                (Singing)
           Shut your fucking face!
           Unclefucka!!

INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

The news anchor shakes his head in disgust.

                     NEWS ANCHOR
           Thanks, midget. Shocking report.  The
           controversy surrounding the Terrance and
           Phillip movie began in the small mountain
           town of South Park, Colorado where the
           local PTA banned the movie.  With us
           tonight is the head of the South Park
           PTA, Sheila Brofloski-

A screen appears with Kyle's mother, looking very pissed. The
TITLE below her reads 'Outraged Mother'.

                     NEWS ANCHOR
           Ms. Brovlofski, how are these kids seeing
           this film? Is bad parenting to blame? Or
           is it Canada?

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Canada!

                     NEWS ANCHOR
           Alright. Here with a counterpoint is the
           Canadian Minister of Movies.

A split screen appears, Kyle's mother on one side, and a
goofy looking Canadian slides into the other.

                     NEWS ANCHOR
           Thank you, Minister, for joining us.

                     CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
           Thanks for having me, buddy.

                     NEWS ANCHOR
           Minister, parents all over America are
           concerned about your country's
           entertainment. Your thoughts?

                     CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
           Well, the film is R rated, and it's not
           intended for children-

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Oh but OF COURSE children are going to
           see it!!

                     CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
           Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The
           fact is that we Canadians are quite
           surprised by your outrage-

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           YOU JUST DON'T CARE!

                     CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
           Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The
           United States has graphic images of
           violence on television all the time, what
           is that one show? COPS? And car crashes
           caught on tape? We can't believe that a
           movie with some foul language and fart
           jokes would piss you off so much.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!

                     CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
           Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ...
           ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.

                     NEWS ANCHOR
           But minister, it isn't like this film is
           the first troublesome thing to come out
           of Canada. Let us not forget Brian Adams
           a few decades ago.

The Minister thinks.

                     CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
           What?

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           The Canadians are just mad that we
           mothers here in South Park have the
           chutzpah to stand up to them!  Like it or
           not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children
           are now safe from your Canadian smut!

INT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY

The boys are in the front row, this time with Wendy, watching
the Terrance and Phillip movie.

                     TERRANCE
           Well, Terrance I hope you learned
           something from this whole experience.

                     PHILLIP
           I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a
           boner biting dick fart fuck face!

The boys laugh merrily. Wendy just looks bored.

                     TERRANCE
           Say Phillip, want to see the Northern
           Lights?

                     PHILLIP
           You bet, Terrance!

Terrance pulls out a match, lights it, then farts.

The flame burns Terrance to a blackened mass.

                     PHILLIP
           HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by
           lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!

                     TERRANCE
                (Just a skull)
           I sure did, Phillip!!

The boys laugh hysterically.

                     STAN
           Did you see that, Wendy?

                     WENDY
           Yup.

EXT. THEATER - DAY

The boys walk out happily.

                     KYLE
           Man, that movie gets better every time I
           see it!

                     CARTMAN
           Yeah, but you know what? That whole part
           about lighting farts is bullshit. You
           can't do that.

                     KENNY
           Mph rmpmh rm.

                     CARTMAN
           No way.

                     STAN
           Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?

                     WENDY
           Stan... I think you and I need some time
           apart.

                     STAN
           WHAT?!

                     CARTMAN
           Oh shit.

                     WENDY
           It's just... It's obvious that we don't
           have a whole lot in common anymore. I
           need somebody who's... a little deeper.

                     STAN
           But Wendy, I can go-

Wendy places her little gloved hand over Stan's mouth.

                     WENDY
           No. Don't speak. You'll only make things
           more annoying. Goodbye, Stan.

And just like that, Wendy is gone. Stan looks almost ready to
cry.

Kyle walks up behind Stan.

                     KYLE
           Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance
           and Phillip is funny can fuck off
           anyways.

                     STAN
                (Insincere)
           Yeah...

The boys walk off.

                     KENNY
           Mph rmph rm!!

                     CARTMAN
           No you can't Kenny!

                     KENNY
           Mph rm rmph!!

                     CARTMAN
           Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED
           DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!

                     KENNY
           Mph mm!

Kenny pulls out a book of matches.

He strikes a match and holds it under his ass.

After a few seconds Kenny farts, and there is a little flame.

Suddenly, the flames catch and Kenny starts burning alive.

                     KENNY
           MMMPMMPH!!! MGMFEODFO!!!

Kenny runs around, and finally falls to the ground, still
burning.

                     STAN
           OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!

                     KYLE
           YOU BASTARD!!

Cartman looks shocked.

                     CARTMAN
           Wow, I guess you CAN do that!

INT. HOSPITAL - LATER

DOCTORS and NURSES are pushing Kenny into the operating room
ER style.

Everything is quick and chaotic. Shouts fill the hallway.

                     NURSE
           CBC chem kit STAT!!

                     DOCTOR GAUCHE
           LOAD THAT I.V. WITH 70CCS OF SODIUM
           PENTOTHAL!!

INT. OPERATING ROOM

It's mid-operation.

                     DOCTOR GAUCHE
           Siphon the fluid off his brain!! Vacuum!

Another nurse hands him a sucker tube.  He immediately shoves
into Kenny's skull.  It starts to slurp and burble.

                     DOCTOR GAUCHE
           Try to untangle his trachea and
           esophagus!

                     NURSE
           Right!

While Doctor Gauche wrestles with Kenny's lungs and torso,
the nurse reaches into Kenny's mouth and pulls both his
windpipe and esophagus out of his mouth, turning them inside
out in the process.

Off to the side, Stan, Cartman and Kyle look on as the doctor
and nurses tangle themselves in knots with Kenny's innards.

                     DOCTOR GAUCHE
           No! THAT DOESN'T GO THERE!!

                     NURSE
           Watch his liver!!!

Kenny's liver POPS out of his torso and slides across the
floor.

                     ASSISTANT
           I'll get it!!!

                     DOCTOR GAUCHE
           We have precious little time left people!
           We're going to lose him soon!!

Suddenly, there is a long, BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP.

                     NURSE
           Doctor, his heart's stopped!

                     DOCTOR GAUCHE
           Crack him.  Let's get it out of there!!!

Doctor Gauche lifts Kenny's heart out of his body.

                     DOCTOR GAUCHE
           We need to zap this, quick!

And runs it to the microwave.  He opens the door.

                     DOCTOR GAUCHE
           Who's making a potato?

                     DOCTOR 2
           My bad, sir.  I missed lunch.

                     DOCTOR GAUCHE
           Damn it! I am NOT going to lose this
           kid!!!!!!

INT. RECOVERY ROOM - LATER

Fade up from black.  We're close on Kenny's face.  His little
eyes start to open.

Doctor Gauche leans over him Kenny.  Stan and Kyle are
there.

                     DOCTOR GAUCHE
           Kenny.  Kenny, can you hear me?

Kenny stirs.

                     KENNY
                (Weakly)
           Mph rmph rm...

                     DOCTOR GAUCHE
           How are you feeling, son?

                     KENNY
           mph.... rmph....

                     DOCTOR GAUCHE
           Great... Son, I have some bad news.  We
           accidentally replaced your heart with a
           baked potato.  You have about seven
           seconds to live.

                     KENNY
           Mrm?!

Just then, Kenny's baked potato heart explodes, splattering
gore all over the inside of the recovery room and on the
outside of Dr. Gauche, Stan and Kyle.

                     STAN
           Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!

                     KYLE
           You bastards!!

                     DOCTOR GAUCHE
           Damn it!  It never gets any easier!
           Anybody get the score of that Broncos
           game?

INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM

Kyle's mother is waiting with the rest of the parents.

The nurse walks up to Kenny's parents with a sad expression.

                     NURSE
           I'm sorry...

Kenny's mother breaks down.

                     KENNY'S MOTHER
           Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

                     KENNY'S DAD
           You bastards!

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           I knew this would happen! Those bastard
           Canadians have now killed a child! Can't
           people see the damage that film is
           doing?!

                     STAN'S MOTHER
           He was killed doing something he saw in
           the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip...
           THEY killed Kenny.

                     CARTMAN'S MOTHER
           You bastards.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           This is it! The time for action is NOW!!
                (Singing)
           Something must be done!
           This is like a spreading rash!
           They're pulling out our children's
           brains
           and filling them with trash!
           Can't you see what this is leading
           to?
           A world of smut and sex and poo!
           I believe the good fight has begun!
           Something must be done!

Everyone gathers around Kyle's mother.

                     STAN'S MOTHER
           I agree!
                (Singing)
           Something must be done!
           We must take action fast!
           My child used to say 'please and
           thank you'
           Now he says suck my ass!

                     CARTMAN'S MOTHER
           And my boy was the sweetest boy the
           world had ever known!
           until those damn Canadians brought
           that filth into our home!
           I agree that there is now a battle
           to be won!
           We can't just stand here singing!
           Something must be done!

                     KENNY'S MOTHER
           But what are we going to do against the
           media machine? It's so big and powerful!

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Right! And we can use that same media
           machine to exploit OUR cause!  We've got
           to let the whole world know what the
           Canadians did to your son!

                     PARENTS
           Yeah!!

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           COME ON!

The parents all head out the door-

EXT. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

The doors to the hospital swing open, and the parents march
out into the street, singing in unison as they go.

                     PARENTS
                (Singing)
           Something must be done!
           Something's gotta give!
           This world has become a bitch in
           which
           we have no desire to live!

Cars come screeching to a halt as the parents sing in the
middle of the road. People start honking their horns in
frustration.

                     KENNY'S MOTHER
           My boy could have become a doctor
           Or a lawyer rich and true
           Instead he burned up like a piggy
           on a bar-b-que!

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           We will fight for children's rights
           in memory of your son!

                     PARENTS
           We can't just stand here singing!
           Something must be done!

Cars are now smashing into each other, and flying off the
road to people's deaths, as the music number has taken over
the busy intersection.

                     PARENTS
           We've pushed and pushed it to the
           edge
           And now the time has come!
           Something's gotta change!
           It's time to buy a gun!
           We can't just stand here singing
           No we can't just stand here singing
           No we can't just stand here
           singing!
           Something must be done!!!

A few more cars careen off and explode into flames as if
ending the song with a borage of fireworks.

INT. OPERATING ROOM -

The boys gather around Kenny's lifeless body.

                     CARTMAN
                (Dazed)
           I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him
           a hundred dollars!

                     KYLE
           Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.

                     CARTMAN
           No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I
           don't have to pay him!

                     KYLE
           Oh.

The boys walk out, leaving Kenny's corpse behind. We can
still hear the boys voices as they exit.

                     KYLE (O.S.)
           I can't believe he's dead.

                     CARTMAN (O.S.)
           Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now.
           Like this has all happened before...

After they leave, PUSH IN to Kenny's dead body, which is
left all alone on the operating table.

The camera continues to zoom in to Kenny's face...

ZOOM IN on Kenny's dead face. We pass into his thoughs...

FLASH!!

EXT. SPACE -

Kenny's body is floating through a great void. A PEACEFUL
SONG plays as he soars upwards to the heavens.

*note - except for Kenny's little construction paper body,
this entire sequence should be done in 3D CGI.

Ahead of him, Kenny can see a great white light. It appears
warm and inviting.

Now Kenny notices large beautiful breasts bobbing up and down
in the heavens. He reaches out to touch them.

Kenny blissfully floats upward toward the bright light and
bobbing breasts. The music crescendos as Kenny gets almost
close enough to the light to touch it.

Just then, a huge, electronic sign pops up. 'Access Denied'.

Suddenly, Kenny goes spiraling downward. The song changes to
a MINISTRY type number as Kenny's surroundings start to
become darker and more twisted.

Kenny's hapless spirit enters a horrifying red tunnel, filled
with flames and heat.

                     KENNY
           Mph rmph rm!

Burning souls SCREAM and CRY all around Kenny, as his body
plunges into what is now obviously the depths of hell.

Kenny passes images of Hitler, John Wayne Gacy, hunger and
disease as he continues through the twisting tunnel.

He then passes images of Jimmy Stewart and Gandhi. All of
whom are opportunely locked in hell for all eternity.

EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY

The same ticket guy from before is at the ticket booth. The
marquee still reads 'Terrance and Phillip' but a huge sticker
has been placed over it that reads 'banned'.

The boys stand underneath the marquee looking baffled.

                     STAN
           How can they do this?

                     KYLE
           It isn't fair!

                     CARTMAN
           Well, Terrance and Phillip are on Conan
           O'Brian tonight, we could at least go
           watch that.

The boys hang their heads and walks away.

The ticket guy suddenly hears a bunch of commotion. He sees a
mob of angry mothers, led by Kyle's mother.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           THIS must be him, officer! This is the
           scum that sold R rated tickets to
           children!

                     TICKET GUY
           What?! Jesus Christ, I didn't mean to!

Barbrady slaps handcuffs on the freaked out teen.

                     OFFICER BARBRADY
           You can explain downtown!

                     TICKET GUY
                (Getting dragged away)
           Oh shit! Hey it's not MY fault! You
           should arrest those pervert Canadians!

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Oh we will, Mr. Scumbag... We will...

           Terrance and Phillip!

A few cheers as Terrance and Phillip walk out on stage. A few
boos as well, and we see that the South Park mothers are in
the audience holding 'Anti-Terrance and Phillip' signs.

Terrance and Phillip walk out and sit next to Brooke Shields.

                     PHILLIP
           Hello, Conan!

                     TERRANCE
           Hello, Brooke Shields!

                     CONAN
           It's nice to have you here in America.

                     PHILLIP
           Yeah, well, you being a Canadian and all,
           we thought what the hell!

                     CONAN O'BRIAN
           So guys... I understand you have a comedy
           routine worked out for us.

                     PHILLIP
           We sure do, Conan. And here it is. Excuse
           me, Terrance.

                     TERRANCE
           Yes, Phillip?

Phillip rips a fart that launches Terrance backwards and into
the band.  They both laugh wildly.

                     PHILLIP
           Gotcha!

Terrance and Phillip laugh. Nobody in the audience laughs.

ANGLE - BOYS

They laugh merrily.

RESUME - THE CONAN O'BRIAN SHOW

                     TERRANCE
           Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.

                     PHILLIP
           Cheers, Terrance!

Terrance extricates himself from the band. Conan is growing
nervous. He looks out into the audience...

Kyle's mother is sitting there, looking angry. Conan makes
eye contact with her, and then nods his head. Kyle's mother
nods back.

                     CONAN O'BRIAN
                (Nervous)
           So, guys, I need to ask you a serious
           question...

                     PHILLIP
           I just farted Terrance back into the
           stone age!

They both laugh hard.

Brooke Shields waits a beat, then belts out a fake laugh.

                     BROOKE SHIELDS
           I farted once on the set of Blue Lagoon!

                     TERRANCE
           Nobody cares, Brooke Shields!

                     CONAN O'BRIAN
           Terrance and Phillip... Whose idea was
           it, to have a person lighting a fart on
           fire in your movie? Who is responsible
           for that?

Terrance and Phillip exhange glances.

                     TERRANCE
           Phillip, I think our friend Conan has
           been working too hard.

                     CONAN O'BRIAN
           Say it! It was YOUR idea to have someone
           light a fart on fire in your movie!

                     PHILLIP/TERRANCE
                (Together)
           It was our idea to have someone light a
           fart on fire in your movie.

ANGLE ON THE AUDIENCE

Kyle's mother is among them, listening to all this.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                (Into her lapel)
           That's it!  Move, move, move!

ANGLE ON TERRANCE AND PHILLIP

A battalion of Army guys appear, seize Terrance and Phillip
and arrest everyone in their group.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Terrance and Phillip, you are under
           arrest for working in America without the
           proper documents! WE GOT YOU!

ANGLE - BOYS

                     KYLE
           Dude, what the hell is going on?

RESUME - THE CONAN O'BRIAN SHOW

                     TERRANCE
           Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed
           by The Conan O'Brian Show!!

                     PHILLIP
           This little scrotum sucker willfully
           deceived us!
                (Pointing to Conan)
           You are a bad man!

                     TERRANCE
           And you call yourself a Canadian!
                (To Phillip)
           I told you we should of done Leno!

Conan O'Brian turns away, ashamed.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Don't listen to them, Mr. O'Brian.
           They're master manipulators. You did a
           good job.

                     TERRANCE
           You loved our movie, Conan!  We watched
           it together.  You... You laughed!

Conan grabs his head.

                     CONAN O'BRIAN
           What have I done?!!!

Conan grabs a gun and blows his head off, dousing Brooke
Shields with blood.

                     BROOKE SHIELDS
           AGAHGAHGGH!!!! Mondays at eight
           AAAGHGH!!!!

Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily. Kyle's mother cradles
Conan's lifeless body.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           You see what your filth has caused?

                     TERRANCE
           US?! This is your mess, outraged mother!!

INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The boys are sitting on the couch in absolute shock.

                     STAN
           Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and
           Phillip!

                     KYLE
           Our moms suck!

                     CARTMAN
           This could mean... No more Terrance and
           Phillip - EVER!

EXT. UNITED NATIONS - DAY

Establishing shot.

INT. UNITED NATIONS - GENERAL ASSEMBLY ROOM

Lots of foreigners with their silly foreign outfits sit at
their stupid microphones with their ridiculous translation
headsets -- in the general assembly hall.  The Canadian
Ambassador stands before them.

                     CANADIAN AMBASSADOR
           As The Canadian Ambassador, I hereby
           condemn the actions taken by America in
           apprehending Terrance and Phillip!

A MURMUR goes through the crowd.

                     CANADIAN AMBASSADOR
           We demand their release IMMEDIATELY!! As
           you can see from this graph, the entire
           economy of Canada relies on Terrance and
           Phillip! Without them we are doomed to
           recession!

The United Nations head bangs his gavel.

Now Kyle's mother stands up. She is with a group of mothers
all wearing M.A.C T-shirts.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           If I may?

Everyone looks at Kyle's mother.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           As president and founder of M.A.C., I
           would like to state-

                     UNITED NATIONS HEAD
           Excuse me, M.A.C.?

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Yes, Mothers Against Canada.

                     UNITED NATIONS HEAD
           Kay.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           I would like to state that Canada must
           learn to stop infiltrating our country
           with its graphic art!

Cheers from the Americans.

                     CANADIAN AMBASSADOR
           Last time I checked America was a free
           country!

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Look at this!

Kyle's mother pulls Kenny's mother up by the head.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           This woman's child was KILLED by your
           country's humor! Look how upset she is!

Kenny's mom looks fine.

                     CANADIAN AMBASSADOR
           We will continue to sell Terrance and
           Phillip videos to anyone retarded enough
           to buy it!!

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Then you leave me no choice... I call for
           an EMBARGO on ALL Canadian Imports!!!

More cheers from the Americans. The Canadians look worried.

INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

The boys are in the check out line at Bob's supermarket.

                     CARTMAN
           What the hell do you mean I can't get
           Cheesy Poofs?!

                     BOB
           Sorry, kid. Cheesy Poofs are a Canadian
           export. We can't carry them any more.

                     KYLE
           Who the hell made up that law?!

                     CARTMAN
           You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD
           Cheesy Poofs? They're a taste sensation
           with a delightful cheddar crunch.

                     BOB
           There's nothing I can do. I can still
           sell you Cheese-o's.

                     CARTMAN
           FUCK Cheese-os and FUCK you!

Cartman storms out. The boys follow him.

INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - DAY

The boys walk into Cartman's house. Cartman slams the door
behind him. The boys all walk toward the living room.

                     CARTMAN
           Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!

                     STAN
           About what?

                     CARTMAN
           About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass! This
           whole thing has gone too far!

                     KYLE
           I don't really think you need Cheesy-
           Poofs, tubby-

But the boys come to an abrupt halt when they reach the
living room and see that all four mothers are waiting for
them, silently.

Everyone just sits there for a second. The lighting on Kyle's
mother's face looks almost evil.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Boys, we have to have a difficult
           discussion.

                     KYLE
           We already know what you did. We saw it
           on television.

                     STAN
           Yeah, how come you arrested Terrance and
           Phillip?

                     STAN'S MOTHER
           Stanly, you're too young to understand
           what's good for you. That's why we
           mothers have taken charge.

                     KYLE
           But they fucking didn't do anything
           wrong!

                     CARTMAN
           Yeah!  And what rim job expert went and
           outlawed Cheesy Poofs!?

The mothers all gasp in horror.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           What was that word, young man!?

                     CARTMAN'S MOTHER
           Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone
           licks your ass for-

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           I know what it is!

                     CARTMAN
                (To his mother)
           Lick someone's ass?!

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           The Terrance and Phillip movie has
           obviously done irreparable damage to
           their brains.  We have to put them in
           rehab right away.

                     KYLE
           What's that?

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           You boys need help.  There are rehab
           centers that specialize in treating
           people with chronic addictions to bad
           language.

                     STAN'S MOTHER
           There are?

Kyle's mother thinks for a second.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Well no, I guess not...  But we will
           establish the first of its kind right
           here in South Park.  All the children in
           town will have to attend and receive
           treatment from the school counselor Mr.
           Mackey!  Ooh I just love when I get these
           sorts of ideas!

                     CARTMAN
           Why?  So you can fuck up our life some
           more?

                     CARTMAN'S MOTHER
           Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that
           way!

                     CARTMAN
           But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to
           fucking bad language!  I don't have a
           fucking problem!

INT. HELL - DAY

Kenny walks through the black void of hell. A trippy, single
shaft of light seems to follow him wherever he goes.

                     KENNY
           Mphrmo?

No answer... No nothing...

Kenny continues on, flames shoot up randomly from the ground
scaring the shit out of him.

                     KENNY
           MPHR!! MMLY MMT!

Suddenly, Kenny hears a CLAWING NOISE. It gets louder and
louder. Kenny starts to run faster and faster. Now the
clawing is RIGHT BEHIND HIM! Kenny spins around. He is face
to face with SATAN!

Satan looks down at Kenny and shoots flames out his nose.

Kenny's eyes bulge open.

                     KENNY
           MMMMMPHPHPHPHP!!!!!

                     SATAN
           Fallen one... We have such sights to show
           you!

Kenny shakes. Satan turns to a whispy form and flashes across
the room like a serpent, in a millisecond he is right up in
Kenny's face.

                     SATAN
           I am Satan. I am your God, now.

                     KENNY
           MPH RM!!!

Kenny tries to run away, but Satan again changes form, flies
across the room and cuts Kenny off.

                     SATAN
           Come with me. I will show you what
           delightful pain awaits.

Two black DEMONS grab Kenny by the arms and start to lead him
away.

                     KENNY
           MMMMMPHPHP!!!!

Just then, SADDAM HUSSEIN show up next to Satan.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell,
           kid! Relax! Take a load off!!

                     SATAN
           You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't
           you?!

Kenny's eyes grow wide.

                     KENNY
           MMMPPH!!!

EXT. REHAB CENTER - DAY

Establishing shot of the small Betty Fordesque building.

INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER

The kids are sitting in chairs in a circle.  There are anti-
drug signs on the walls: "Crack is Whack"; "Get High on
Pottery"; and, "I Go From Zero to Bitch in .9 Seconds."  MR.
MACKEY, the wiry school counselor, leads the group.  There's
a pottery wheel and lots of craft tables behind them.

                     MR. MACKEY
           Mkay, it's come to my attention, that you
           boys have a potty-mouth problem, mkay.
           Now the sooner you recognize your
           problem, mkay, the sooner we can get you
           back to your third grade homeroom where
           you belong.

                     KYLE
           But they're just words, Mr. Mackey. Our
           parents are over-reacting.

                     BEBE
           Yeah, Wendy's here, and she doesn't even
           like Terrance and Phillip!

Wendy looks bored. Stan tries to smile at her, but she
doesn't even acknowledge him.

Meanwhile, Cartman is violently shaking in his seat.

                     CARTMAN
           Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having
           Cheesy Poof withdrawal...

                     MR. MACKEY
           Mkay, kids from all over the State have
           been brought here, because you all share
           the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's
           start with you.

He points at Gregory. The little British bastard from the
lake.

                     GREGORY
           My name is Gregory... And I have a potty
           mouth.

Wendy looks at Gregory. Stan notices this.

                     CARTMAN
           You've got a stupid accent too.

                     MR. MACKEY
           Eric, that is not appropriate.

                     CARTMAN
           What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the
           ear.

                     MR. MACKEY
           Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly
           what I'm talking about. We have to change
           the way you think.

                     GREGORY
           How are you gonna do that?

Mr. Mackey crosses to a piano. He plays chords while speaking
the following lines.

                     MR. MACKEY
           There are times when you get suckered in,
           by drugs and alcohol and sex with wom-en.
           But it's when you do these things too
           much
                (Singing)
           That you've got to clear your head
           and get back in touch...

Mr. Mackey plays the piano and sings:

                     MR. MACKEY
           You can do it, it's all up to you,
           mkay?
           With a method, there's nothing you
           can't do, mkay?
           You don't have to spend your life
           addicted to crack
           Homeless on the streets giving hand-
           jobs for cash
           as long as you follow this simple
           plan
           I'm fully convinced that it's,
           easy, mkay...

The kids are extremely disinterested. Mackey walks over to a
chalkboard.

                     MR. MACKEY
           Step one: Think about fun. Think
           about all that you'll miss addicted
           to this
           Step two: Think it all through.
           Think how's this gonna change my
           life, what am I gonna miss?
           Step three: Go and hug a tree, Hug
           anything that gets in your way!
           And step four: Just don't do it
           anymore - it's easy, Mkay!

Mackey gets the children in a circle all holding hands.

                     MR. MACKEY
           Come on, kids! Sing along!

                     KIDS
                (Extremely half-assed)
           You can do it, it's all up to you
           mkay?
           With a method, there's nothing you
           can't do, mkay?
           We don't have to spend our lives
           addicted to crack
           Homeless on the streets giving hand-
           jobs for cash

                     MR. MACKEY
           As long as you follow my simple
           plan
           I'm fully convinced that it's,
           easy, mkay...

Everyone starts dancing in a circle.

                     KIDS
           Step one: Think about fun. Think
           about all that you'll miss addicted
           to this Step two: Think it all
           through. Think how's this gonna
           change my life, what am I gonna
           miss?
           Step three: Go and hug a tree, Hug
           anything that gets in your way!
           And step four: Just don't do it
           anymore - it's easy, Mkay!

                     MR. MACKEY
           It's easy, Mkay?!

Everyone falls down laughing.

INT. REHAB CENTER - LOUNGE

Kyle's mom and the other moms watch the kids and Mr. Mackey
rolling around on the floor laughing on a security monitor.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           What the hell do they think this is?!
           Summer camp?!

INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER

Just then, Kyle's mother walks in with a scowling look,
interupting the kids and Mr. Mackey who are still laughing
merrily. The other mothers are behind her.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Mr. Mackey, what is going on?!

Mr. Mackey stands up, looking scared.

                     MR. MACKEY
           Uh, we're just, starting our program...

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           This is NOT a place for fun and games!
           This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!!
           We at MAC have a trial to go to!

The mothers walk away.

                     MR. MACKEY
           Mkay.

                     CARTMAN
           God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.

Kyle hangs his head.

EXT. SUPREME COURT - DAY

A news reporter stands in front of the Supreme Court. All
around him are protestors, with signs that say CANADA NO! and
CAN'TADA! Still others hold signs with Kenny on them.

                     NEWS REPORTER
           Tom I'm standing in front of the U.S.
           Supreme Court where the most important
           trial of the - day - is happening.
           Thousands of people have shown up from
           all over the country to show their
           outrage and disgust at Canada. Joining me
           now is Mrs. McKormick, mother of the poor
           little boy who was killed by the
           Canadians.

Kenny's mother steps into frame. She is wearing a shirt with
Kenny's picture on it. Written on the T-shirt is 'Have you
seen my son? No, you haven't. He's dead.'

                     NEWS REPORTER
           Mrs. McKormick, you must really hate the
           Canadians.

                     KENNY'S MOTHER
           Yes, yes I do, Tom.

                     NEWS REPORTER
           Did you ever think you would see the day
           when thousands of people were wearing
           your son Kenny on T-shirts?

                     KENNY'S MOTHER
           No I didn't. But if any of you would like
           one they're 14.95. Available in blue or
           white.

The reporter thinks for a second, and then turns back to the
camera.

                     NEWS REPORTER
           Well, we can only imagine the intense,
           vehement trial that is going on inside.

INT. SUPREME COURT - DAY

Terrance and Phillip are on the stand.

                     JOHNNY COCHRAN
           Terrance and Phillip... You knowingly,
           with malice of forethought were trying to
           destroy American culture, yes or no?

Terrance rips a fart.

                     JOHNNY COCHRAN
           YES OR NO!

INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER

The kids are all in the main room, sitting on a couch,
huddled around a television.

They laugh merrily.

                     STAN
           Shh! Mr. Mackey's gonna hear us!

INT. SUPREME COURT - DAY

                     TERRANCE
           The Americans are just showing their TRUE
           COLORS as smelly bastards.

                     PHILLIP
           Fight the power!

                     TERRANCE
           The young boy that died lit himself on
           fire. It was unfortunate, but how can
           they blame US?

                     PHILLIP
           Don't believe the hype!!

Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER

The kids all shout agreement.

                     KIDS
                (Adlib)
           Yeah! WooHoo!

BACK TO COURTHOUSE

Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

                     TERRANCE
           You cannot oppress us! We will continue
           to pursue our art. We know there are
           Americans out there who will help us!

Kyle's mother now stands up from the prosecutor's table.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Your 'ART' is shallow and immature! We
           Americans do NOT allow that for our
           children!!

                     PHILLIP
           Please. You teach your children that
           America is the land of the free. But it's
           all bullshit. You're one of the most
           conservative countries in the world!

INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER

The children all listen, wide-eyed.

INT. SUPREME COURT - DAY

                     TERRANCE
           The problem is you don't allow your
           children to think for themselves. You try
           to raise them in a protective bubble, and
           then when they finally get old enough,
           they realize they've been lied to, and
           they resent you for it.

                     PHILLIP
           Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so
           fucked up.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           THAT IS ENOUGH!!

                     TERRANCE
           WAKE UP AMERICA! YOUR government censors
           YOU from the world.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           NO THEY DON'T!

                     PHILLIP
           YES THEY DO! AND I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU! IN
           MARCH OF LAST YEAR, THE AMERICAN
           GOVERNMENT-

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP.

Suddenly, the screen goes blank. A sign that says 'PLEASE
STAND BY' comes on.

INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER

The kids all watch, wide-eyed.

                     KYLE
           What happened?

                     WENDY
           The station CONVENIENTLY went blank.

INT. CANADIAN PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY

The Canadian Prime Minister stands directly in front of
camera, looking right at us.

                     CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER
           ATTENTION AMERICA!! You have taken our
           national treasure Terrance and Phillip.
           We, in turn, have taken yours... The
           Smothers Brothers!

The Canadian Prime Minister steps out of the way, revealing
the Smothers Brothers tied up in chairs behind him.

                     CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER
           I'll let you catch your breath... Now,
           release Terrance and Phillip, or else we
           will EXECUTE your beloved Smothers
           Brothers!!

                     TOMMY SMOTHERS
           Please listen to them!!

                     DICK SMOTHERS
           They're not fucking around!!

                     CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER
           We're not fucking around. This is not
           aboot deals. This aboot dignity. This is
           aboot freedom... This is aboot respect.
           RETURN Terrance and Phillip NOW!!!

Another Canadian leans in and whispers in the Prime
Minister's ear.

                     CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER
           Oh yeah... AND FUCK YOU, AMERICA!

He raises his middle finger, but it's all blurred and
digitized.

INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER

                     MR. MACKEY
           Okay kids, for today's rehabilitation
           activity, we're going to watch the
           Terrance and Phillip movie.

                     STAN
           What?!

                     KYLE
           Sweet!

                     MR. MACKEY
           Now, this is an EDITED version of the
           movie, which was put out by the MPAA.
           That's the Motion Picture Association of
           America.

                     WENDY
           Isn't that censorship?

                     MR. MACKEY
           No the MPAA is NOT a censorship group.

                     WENDY
           Why not?

                     MR. MACKEY
           Uh... Because they say so... Mkay. Now I
           want you to watch this movie, with all
           the immature profanity taken out, and
           notice how much better a movie it
           becomes...

Mackey puts the tape in and hits play.

The TITLES come up 'Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire'
Except that 'Asses' has been blurred out, and replaced with
'bunz'.

                     KIDS
           HOORAY!!!

The movie begins. Phillip walks in. But it isn't Phillip's
voice, somebody has dubbed him over.

                     DUBBED PHILLIP
           Hey Terrance. I feel like I'm going to
           pass gas near your head.

                     DUBBED TERRANCE
           I would rather you didn't, Phillip.

                     DUBBED PHILLIP
           Oh? Is that so?

Phillip farts on Terrance.

                     TERRANCE
           Oh, you are such a maroon!

                     PHILLIP
           You would know, dummy.

The boys look confused.

                     TERRANCE
           You are pigeon-like in your intelligence.

The pseudo-Terrance and Phillip laugh. Terrance throws a
match on Phillip and Phillip burns to death.

A TITLE comes up - THE END.

And the credits roll.

                     CARTMAN
           WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!

                     KYLE
           Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!

The lights in the theater come up.

                     MR. MACKEY
           So you see, the point and the theme of
           the film is kept intact. And of course,
           the MPAA didn't cut out any of the
           graphic violence. What did you think?

                     CARTMAN
           Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to
           get the taste of ass out of my mouth from
           that piece of shit movie.

                     MR. MACKEY
           Eric, you're not watching your mouth!

                     CARTMAN
           You get me Cheesy Poofs with the
           delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch
           my fucking mouth!

                     MR. MACKEY
           Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated.
           Help me to help you!

                     CARTMAN
           Help yourself prickfuck!

                     MR. MACKEY
           I am not a prickfuck, mkay? You little
           asshole!

Mackey slaps his hand over his mouth and looks around, scared.

                     CARTMAN
           Ha, ha, you stupid asshole prickfuck.

INT. REHAB CENTER - SEPARATE ROOM

Mr. Mackey is in a private office with the members of M.A.C.

           How is the children's progress?

                     MR. MACKEY
           Very encouraging. Most of the children
           have been weened from their naughty
           mouths.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER

                     MR. MACKEY
                (Nervous)
           Well, some of the children just don't
           respond to 12 step programs.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Then we'll have to resort to plan B and
           call the v-chip organization.

Dramatic MUSIC STING. Mackey looks afraid.

                     MR. MACKEY
           Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been
           fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                (Evil)
           I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate
           times call for desperate measures, Mr.
           Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of
           your situation.

                     MR. MACKEY

                     CARTMAN
           I don't graduate?! WHAT THE FUCK IS
           THIS?! THIS IS BULLSHIT?!

Just then, Mackey notices the little buttons on everybody's
shirts.

                     MR. MACKEY
           Free Terrance and Phillip? Oh no... Mkay.

                     KYLE
                (Proudly)
           We're protesting!

                     STAN
           Yeah!

                     MR. MACKEY
           Well, boys, it might interest you to know
           that your FRIENDS the Canadians have just
           bombed the U.S.

                     STAN
           They did?!

                     MR. MACKEY
           Yes, at six this morning they bombed the
           heck out of Cleveland.

                     KYLE
           Oh. That doesn't count.

                     WENDY
           They only bombed Cleveland because we're
           going to Execute two of their citizens!!

                     MR. MACKEY
           Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting
           political, I'll throw your skinny little
           butt right back into rehab. Mkay?

                     CARTMAN
           HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?!
           DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!

                     MR. MACKEY
           No, Eric... I'm afraid it's phase two for
           you...

Dramatic MUSIC sting.

INT. HELL - DAY

Kenny is chained up in a torture chamber in Hell.  Demons and
ghouls surround him.

                     SATAN
           Prepare thyself for unending pain!
           Unparalleled misery!!

Kenny starts to cry.

Saddam Hussein comes out from behind Satan holding a martini.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked
           up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer
           again.

                     KENNY
           Mrph mprph!!

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           What? What do you mean you don't belong
           here? Relax guy, hell is for children.

                     KENNY
           Mrph mprhm mm rmph!

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           A deal? You wanna make a deal with the
           devil. Well sure, deals are mounds o'
           fun.

                     SATAN
                (To Saddam)
           Saddam, would you let me do my job
           please!

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid
           wants.

                     KENNY
           Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Oh, you want out of hell, huh?

                     SATAN
           Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The
           whole POINT of hell is that you don't
           WANT to be here!

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you
           want out of hell, all you have to do is
           collect 10 proofs of purchases from
           'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich,
           chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring
           me ten proofs of purchases and we'll
           grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.

                     KENNY
           Mrph?

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky
           Smores are now available in stores
           everywhere! No biggie!

Saddam walks over to Kenny and releases his chains.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
                (To Kenny)
           Well what are you waiting for pal?!  Get
           to it!

Kenny runs out and away.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           HA HA HAHA!! What a dumbass!!

Saddam walks over and joins Satan on the couch.

                     SATAN
           I don't see why you have to belittle me
           in front of people like that.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke.
           Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only
           available up on Earth. He'll never get
           'em, see?

                     SATAN
           Sometimes I just think you don't have any
           respect for me.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Hey, come here, guy.

Saddam pulls Satan around and plants a big wet kiss on him.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Who's my cream puff?

                     SATAN
           I am.

INT. PTA MEETING - DAY

A large crowd of parents has gathered for a PTA meeting.

Kenny's mother is at a table selling dead Kenny t-shirts. She
has a shitload of money all around her. Another MOTHER walks
up, hands Kenny's mom money, and gets a shirt.

                     MOTHER
           Is that a new pearl bracelet, Mrs.
           McKormick?

                     KENNY'S MOTHER
           Why yes. Yes it is.

Meanwhile, Kyle's mother is on the stand.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           As our next official order of business
           here at M.A.C., we will test the new V-
           chip. As most of you know, the V-chip was
           created to lock children out of watching
           certain shows on television. And now the
           N.I.H. has created a new, exciting
           product that they can tell us all about.
           Here is the Surgeon General, Dr.
           Pangloss.

DOCTOR PANGLOSS, a lab technician in white takes the podium.

                     DOCTOR PANGLOSS
           Thank you, parents.

One person claps. Pangloss hits a button and a slide
projector starts showing pictures of the device.

                     DOCTOR PANGLOSS
           The machinery of the new 'V-chip' is very
           simple, and similar to that of the V-
           chip. The chip is placed just under the
           subject's skin, where it emits a small
           but painful shock of electricity whenever
           an obscenity is uttered.

The parents are fascinated.

                     STAN'S FATHER
           Now wait a minute, are you telling us
           that this chip somehow KNOWS if the kid
           is swearing?

                     DOCTOR PANGLOSS
           It's just like a lie detector. Certain
           things happen in you when you swear just
           like when you lie, the chip picks up on
           this and gives the subject a shock.

The parents AD LIB 'Ooohs' and 'Ahhhhs'

                     DOCTOR PANGLOSS
           We are very excited to see the results of
           this test.
                (Calling)
           Patient 453, would you step out here,
           please?

Cartman steps out wearing a hospital gown.

                     DOCTOR PANGLOSS
           Patient 453 here has been fitted with the
           new v-chip...

                     CARTMAN
           My head hurts.

                     DOCTOR PANGLOSS
           Don't worry about that. Now, I want you
           to say 'Doggy.'

                     CARTMAN
           Doggy.

                     DOCTOR PANGLOSS
           Notice that nothing happens.
                (To Cartman)
           Now say 'Montana.'

                     CARTMAN
           Montana.

                     DOCTOR PANGLOSS
           Good. Now 'Pillow'.

                     CARTMAN
           Pillow.

                     DOCTOR PANGLOSS
           Alright, now I want you to say
           'horsefucker.'

Cartman looks offstage to his mother.

                     CARTMAN'S MOTHER
           Go ahead, it's alright, Eric.

Cartman smiles.

                     CARTMAN
           Horsefuck-

BZZZZZAAAAT!!!!

                     CARTMAN
           AGAAHGAHGAH!!!!!

Cartman falls to the floor in pain. All the parents ooh and
ahh and applaud.

                     CARTMAN
           OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-

BAZAAATTT!!

                     CARTMAN
           OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T
           FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--

BAZAAATTT!!

                     DOCTOR PANGLOSS
           Success!! Our device works perfectly! We
           will begin mass production immediately!

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           And so we have succesfully removed the
           Canadian smut from all of our children's
           brains.
           We have made changes at school to ensure
           that our kids are NEVER AGAIN exposed to
           smut!!!!!!! It's OVER!

The crowd goes wild.

EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

School is now Naziesque. A military drum echoes in the
distance.

INT. CLASSROOM - SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY

Stan and Kyle are sitting in their desks, waiting for school
to begin.

Wendy walks by on her way to her desk.

                     STAN
           Hi Wendy.

                     WENDY
                (Not even looking)
           Hi Stan.

Wendy walks on by.

                     KYLE
           Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats
           ass about you.

                     STAN
                (Eyes still on Wendy)
           I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!

                     KYLE
           Good thing she was never your
           girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.

Cartman walks in and gingerly sits down.

                     KYLE
           Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in
           your head or your ass?

                     STAN
           What's the difference?

Stan and Kyle laugh.

                     CARTMAN
           Very funny dickhead-

BZZAAT!  The v-chip shocks Cartman.

                     CARTMAN
           OW!  FUCK-

BZZZAAAT!!

                     CARTMAN
           AY!

Cartman is thrown to the floor in a shivering heap.

                     KYLE
           Whoa!  What the hell was that?!

                     STAN
           Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him
           ever time he cusses!

Stan and Kyle look at each other.  Kyle smiles.

                     KYLE
           Hey Cartman.

                     CARTMAN
           What?

                     KYLE
           You know, me and Stan were just talking
           about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck
           you are.

                     CARTMAN
           Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-

BZAAAT!

                     CARTMAN
           SHIT-

BZZZAAAT!!

                     CARTMAN
           FUCK-

BZZAAAT!!  The cycle continues as Stan and Kyle laugh merrily
watching Cartman flopping around on the floor.

                     KYLE
           This is sweet!!

                     STAN
           Totally!

Garrison stands before his class.

                     MR. GARRISON
           Okay, children, let's try a few new math
           problems. What is five times two?

The kids all just sit there.

                     MR. GARRISON
           Come on, children, do be shy, just give
           it your best shot.

Clyde raises his hand.

                     MR. GARRISON
           Yes, Clyde?

                     CLYDE
           Twelve?

                     MR. GARRISON
           Okay, now let's try to get an answer from
           somebody who's not a complete retard.
           Anyone? Come on don't be shy...

Just then, the door bursts open and in walks a couple of Nazi
looking American soldiers.

They walk over to the children and start pulling off their
'Free Terrance and Phillip' pins.

                     STAN
           Hey, what are you doing?

                     SOLDIER
           You can't wear these in school. It's
           against school policy, thank you.

Another solider rips off Kyle's pin and replaces it with a
yellow star.

                     KYLE
           What's that for?

                     SOLDIER 2
           You get a star for doing well in school.

Just as quickly, the soldiers make their way out the door.

                     WENDY
           NAZIS!!

                     STAN
           What's the matter, Wendy?

                     WENDY
           Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.

                     STAN
                (To Kyle)
           God damn it, why does she keep saying
           that?

INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

The boys are in line. Nazi-ish soldiers usher them through.

                     STAN
           I'm so sick of these soldiers.

                     KYLE
           Yeah, they suck.

                     CARTMAN
           I know.  Always saying, do this, do that.
           They think they're so cooool.
                (To the soldier)
           Acht lieben kraft auct shpiler!
                (BZZZT)
           OW!!!

The soldier glares at him. The boys walk into the kitchen,
where they are greeted by their big, happy, black school
CHEF!

                     CHEF
           Hello there, children!!

                     STAN
           Hey, Chef.

                     CHEF
           How would like some Salisbury Steak with
           buttered noodles?

                     KYLE
           We can't, we're on a hunger strike.

                     CHEF
           A hunger strike? For what?

                     STAN
           To free Terrance and Phillip.

                     CARTMAN
           But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.

                     STAN
           Chef, do you know anything about women?

                     CHEF
           Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?

                     KYLE
           I don't know.

                     CHEF
           Children, I know ALL there is to know
           about women.

                     STAN
           What's the secret to making a woman
           happy?

                     CHEF
                (Dishing out food)
           Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the
           clitoris.

                     STAN
           Huh?

Suddenly, Chef realizes who he's talking to.

                     CHEF
           Oops, I guess you haven't got that far
           in your anatomy class, huh?

                     STAN
           No, what does that mean, find the
           clitoris?

                     CARTMAN
           Is that like finding Jesus or something?

Now Chef starts to panic.

                     CHEF
           Uh... Nothing. Forget I said anything.
           Now move along, children! You're holding
           up the line!

Just then, the P.A. blares out an announcement.

                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA (O.S.)

           Woa, I wonder what's going on, dude.

INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

All the elementary students are gathered in front of a large
television monitor.

Mr. Garrison and his class walk in and look confused.

The boys walk up to Chef.

                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
           Please take your seats, everyone!!!!

They all go to their seats.

                     KYLE
           What's going on, Chef?

                     CHEF
           Something big, children.

The television goes from that Emergency broadcast signal to a
scene of a news anchor sitting at his desk.

                     NEWS ANCHOR
               (Very serious)

The President is sitting in a chair by the fireplace.

                     PRESIDENT CLINTON
           Ladies and gentlemen... At five a.m.
           today, a day which will live in infamy...
           sort of... the U.S. has declared war on
           Canada.

ANGLE - KIDS

They all stare in silence. Mr. Garrison takes a deep breath.

                     CHEF
           Oh, no...

                     MR. MACKEY
           I don't believe it.

                     CARTMAN
           Holy crap-
               (BZZZT!)
           OW!! Hey crap isn't a swear word, what
           the fuck?!
               (ZZZZZZTTT)
           AGAGAGH!!!

                     PRESIDENT CLINTON
           All Canadians are to leave the country
           immediately, or be subject to military
           camps. All Canadian products are to be
           thrown out.

                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
           How can they do this?

                     MR. GARRISON
           I never thought there would be war again
           in my lifetime...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

                     PRESIDENT CLINTON
           Do not be afraid of this war. Instead
           embrace it. We have God on our side. And
           besides, they're just Canadians, what the
           hell are they gonna do?

INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

Everyone watches the television in stunned silence.

                     STAN
           Chef, what does it mean that we're at
           war?

                     CHEF
           It's... It's not good children.

                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
           What do we do? Do we go on as normal
           or...?

                     MR. GARRISON
           I don't know Principal Victoria... I
           don't know...

                     PRESIDENT
           And now, I would like to bring up the
           woman who led, and is still leading the
           way in this glorious stand-

                     KYLE
               (Pointing to TV)
           HOLY SHIT DUDE!!

Kyle's mom appears on the TV dressed in military garb.

                     PRESIDENT
           Mrs. Sheila Brovlofski.

                     CHEF
           Isn't that your mother, Kyle?

Kyle can't believe it.

On the television, Kyle's mother walks up to the podium. She
is dressed to the hilt. She hugs the President and the first
lady and then takes a deep breath.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           My fellow Americans. I have led this
           fight in the War against profanity. I
           have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our
           neighbor to the north has abused us for
           the last time.

                     PRESIDENT
           As Commander in chief, I have ordered our
           Army to set up defensive positions along
           the US-Canada border in anticipation of
           an attack.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           What about air strikes?

                     PRESIDENT
           Huh?

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           We have to have air strikes on their
           military and entertainment centers.  It's
           the only way to ensure that their smut
           can't reach American soil!

                     PRESIDENT
           Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes
           are necessary.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Not necessary?!  Mr. President, may I
           remind you that our country's heart and
           soul are at stake, and our children's
           minds are the battlefield!
           The bastard Canadians want to fight us
           because we won't tolerate their potty
           mouths. Well, if it is war they want...
           THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!

A huge eruption of cheers from the crowd in front of Kyle's
mother. She is obviously floored by it. She can't help but
smile. She actually holds her head up higher, and then raises
her arms up in two peace signs, as the cheers get louder.

The president forces a smile and actually applauds with the
rest of the crowd.

Back in the gymnasium, Kyle looks thoroughly embarrassed.

                     CHEF
           Damn, your mom's a bitch, Kyle.

                     CARTMAN
           Amen to that.

INT. HELL - DAY

Kenny is sadly walking around hell. He walks up to another
one of hell's prisoners.

                     KENNY
           Mph rmph rm rmph rm?

                     GEORGE BURNS
           Snacky Smores? Why the hell would I have
           proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores?
           Beat it, kid.

Kenny moves along. He hears some voices coming from a door.
Kenny opens the door and peeps inside-

INT. SATAN'S BEDROOM - KENNY'S POV

Saddam and Satan are lying in bed.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           You just get cranky when you're tired,
           that's all.  I told you that you
           shouldn't have tried to carry that futon
           all by yourself.

                     SATAN
           I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not
           too big to carry myself-

Just then, Satan hears a reporter on CNN.

                     TV
           In war news, countries from Europe and
           Asia are joining sides in the Canadian-
           American War-

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           -Listen butterbuns, let's make love and
           forget about the whole thing-

                     SATAN
           SHHH!!!!

                     TV
           ...The death count is already on its way
           to 10 million with no signs of slowing
           down.  What started as a spat between the
           United States and Canada is quickly
           turning into World War III-

Kenny's eyes bulge, he wants to see more, but Satan clicks
off the television and sits up in bed.

                     SATAN
           It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen
           are drawing nigh!  The time of the
           prophecy is upon us!

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Oh I love when you get all biblical
           Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my
           crank!

                     SATAN
           No I'm being serious! Those Canadian
           entertainers are to be killed. It is the
           seventh sign.

Satan walks over to large pedestal which holds an ancient
tome.  Satan turns the pages as he talks.

                     SATAN
           Behold, the signs of my reign on earth
           are all falling into place!  The fall of
           an empire-

He points to an ancient-looking picture of the death of
Ceasar.

                     SATAN
           -The coming of a comet-

He points to a picture of a comet passing by Earth.

                     SATAN
           Jerry Springer's movie doing more than
           ten million box office-

A picture of Jerry Springer holding a bunch of money.

                     SATAN
           ....And now....

Satan points to an ancient drawing on the wall. It looks like
Terrance and Phillip being stabbed in the head.

                     SATAN
           The seventh sign!  When the blood of
           these Canadians touches American soil...
           It will be my time to rise!!!!!

DRAMATIC music.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!

                     SATAN
           Do you always think about sex?  I'm
           talking about some very important stuff
           here!

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Listen buttercup, let's make love and
           forget about the whole thing.

                     SATAN
           Is sex the only thing that matters to
           you?

Saddam thinks for a second.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           I love you.

Satan sits with his arms crossed and a frown.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           You know I do.

                     SATAN
           I know.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           So what do you say we shut off that light
           and get close, huh?

Satan reaches over and turns off the light.  Everything goes
pitch black. The light goes off of Kenny's face as well.

A beat.

Then, a small moan from Satan.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Yeah, you like that, don't you bitch?

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY

Stan and Kyle are walking down South Park Avenue. Stan is
reading out of a huge book.

                     KYLE
           Does it say what the clitoris is?

                     STAN
           All it says is that it's above the
           vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?

                     KYLE
           Isn't that in Arizona or something?

Stan and Kyle walk into the middle of town, where a HUGE
bonfire of Terrance and Phillip videos, posters, and Canadian
items like syrup and hockey sticks are burning away.

The soldiers throw Stan's book on top of the pile, and it
starts to burn.

Stan and Kyle walk up to where Cartman is standing.

                     STAN
           What is this?

                     CARTMAN
           They're burning all the Canadian stuff
           cause of the war.

                     STAN
           That book wasn't Canadian!

Clyde, one of the kids from school, throws his Terrance and
Phillip dolls into the burning mass.

Kyle stops him on his way back.

                     KYLE
           Dude, don't you like Terrance and Phillip
           anymore?

                     CLYDE
           Of course not! We're at war! My daddy
           says I HATE Canadians now!

More kids line up to burn their Terrance and Phillip stuff.

Several random mothers from M.A.C. are standing in front of
the bonfire with anti-Canadian signs and T-shirts. The boys'
parents aren't around, but another MAC mother is leading the
charge.

                     MAC MOTHER
           THAT'S IT! BURN EVERYTHING CANADIAN!!!
           MAKE OUR COUNTRY DECENT AGAIN FOR OUR
           CHILDREN!!!

A townsperson throws Alanis Morisette albums into the fire.

Another townsperson runs up and throws in a bag of Cheesy
Poofs.

                  CARTMAN
           NNOOOO!!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! OH, WHY
           GOD, WHY?!

Cartman falls to his knees and cries as the Cheesy Poofs burn
away.

                     CARTMAN
           This is all cause of your mom, Kyle.
           She's such a bitch-
               (BBBZAATT!!)
           AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.

                     KYLE
           And she's getting worse...

                     STAN
           Dude... Isn't that your brother?

Kyle looks to where a group of big, mean FIFTH GRADERS have
encircled Ike.

                     FIFTH GRADER
           Why don't you go back to your own
           country, CANADIAN!

                     FIFTH GRADER 2
           Yeah, go eat some potatoes and ride
           donkeys!

                     IKE
           Eee todo ba!

Kyle's eyes grow wide. He dashes over.

                     KYLE
           Hey! Leave him alone!

                     FIFTH GRADER
           It's just a smelly Canadian. They're like
           rats.

                     KYLE
           He's my brother!

                     FIFTH GRADER
           You don't look Canadian.

                     KYLE
           He's adopted!

Kyle picks his brother up and tries to protect him.

                     FIFTH GRADER
           Well you better get his beady eyed
           Canadian ass out of America before my
           daddy finds him!!

The boys watch in horror as the fifth graders run over and
throw more Canadian items into the fire.

                     KYLE
           It's only a matter of time before my mom
           has HIM burned too!

                     STAN
           What has the world come to? This is
           horrible. We're locked up, burning books,
           hating other people-

                     CARTMAN
           -no Cheesy Poofs.

                     STAN
           -No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is
           happening?

DRAMATIC MUSIC begins.

                     KYLE
           I don't know. But it has gone far enough!
           I'm sick of it!
               (Singing)
           Something must be done!
           Change has got to come around!
           They're taking all our laughter
           and burning it to the ground!
           Can't you see what this is leading
           to?
           A world of chains and ties and
           glue!
           We have to fight before they've
           taken every one!
           Something must be done!

                     STAN
           I agree! The only way to save our future
           is to unite and fight!
               (Singing)
           Something must be done!
           We must take action fast!
           My parents have gotten so strict
           they forgot they were children in
           the past!

                      CARTMAN
           And my mom has become so bu-sy
           that she's raising heck and
           ignoring me
           I agree that there is now a battle
           to be won!
           Something must be done!

                     STAN
           But what are we going to do against this
           entire army?

                     KYLE
           We've gotta get the word out. We'll get
           on my dad's computer and use the
           internet! Come on you guys!

The boys proudly head down the street.

                     BOYS
           Something must be done!
           Something's gotta give!
           This world has become a bitch in
           which
           we have no desire to live!

(*note- cartman gets shocked again on 'bitch')

                     BOYS
           We've pushed it to the edge
           And now the time has come!
           Something's gotta change!
           Something must be done!
           Something must be done!!!

INT. KYLE'S HOUSE - KYLE'S DAD'S OFFICE

Kyle is at the keyboard of his dad's computer. Stan and
Cartman are waiting in the background.

                     KYLE
           Okay... I just need to find a few private
           message boards...

                     STAN
           Wait! Before we put a message out, do a
           search on the word 'clitoris'.

                     KYLE
           Okay...

Kyle types in the word and hits return.

                     KYLE
               (Reading the screen)
           "Found Eight Million Pages With the Word
           Clitoris"!

                     STAN
           Wow!

                     KYLE
           I'll just try the first one.

Kyle clicks the mouse. They wait for the screen to load.
Finally, it does.

                     KYLE
           Dude! It's a lady giving a blow job to a
           horse!

Stan and Cartman rush over.

                     STAN
           Is it Cartman's mom?

                     CARTMAN
           Very funny!

                     KYLE
           Hey... It IS Cartman's mom!!

Cartman looks at the screen.

                     CARTMAN
           Oh, son of a bitch!
               (ZZAP!!)
           AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!

                     STAN
           Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!

Ike bounces in, happily.

                     IKE
           Ber dada!

                     KYLE
           Get out of here Ike, you're too young for
           this stuff!

                     IKE
           Papa mama simi.

Ike bounces out.

                     CARTMAN
           Come on, just get to the message board!

                     KYLE
           I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian
           server... I've got to break into the main
           frame...

Kyle furiously hits a bunch of keys.

                     KYLE
           Damn it! They've got an access code! I'll
           try to reroute the encryptions...

Kyle furiously hits a bunch more keys.

                     STAN
           Dude, do you know what you're doing?

                     KYLE
           No, dude, all you have to do is hit the
           keys really fast and say a bunch of
           stupid shit and it works.

Just then the screen pops up. Access Granted.

                     KYLE
           Bingo. Okay, here we go...
               (Typing)
           Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet
           us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn
           tomorrow night...

                     CARTMAN
           Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.

                     KYLE
           We're not gonna have pie and punch!

                     CARTMAN
           More people will come if they think
           there'll be pie and punch!

                     KYLE
               (Typing)
           pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The
           password is...

The boys all think...

                     STAN
               (Dramatically)
           La Resistance.

Triumphant MUSIC cue.

INT. KYLE'S ATTIC

The door to the attic pops open.  Kyle shoves Ike up into the
attic.

                     KYLE
           You stay up here in the attic, Ike.
           Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?

                     IKE
           Uhh...

                     KYLE
           Goodnight, Ike, we're all going to bed.

The door closes and it is dark.

Ike blinks. He looks out a small window, onto the street
below.

A few armed soldiers walk by.

Ike pulls out a little plastic harmonica and sadly starts to
play.

INT. PENTAGON - NIGHT

Tons of MILITARY PERSONNEL are running to and fro. Giant
computer screens show Canada's latest attacks.

                     SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
           Sir! The Canadians have destroyed Des
           Moines!!

                     PRESIDENT
           How can you tell?

Everyone laughs merrily.

                     SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
           Good one, sir!

Suddenly, a PENTAGON GUY runs up to the President, holding
some papers.

                     PENTAGON GUY
           Sir, we're tracking a signal crossing
           into Canadian computers! It looks like we
           may have a resistance movement
           starting...

The President grabs the papers and dashes over to Kyle's
mother, who is standing there looking smug, with her arms
behind her back and her chest out. She has a few military
badges on her.

                     PRESIDENT
               (Showing her the papers)
           Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance...
           It's probably Canadian spies!!

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Well find out where that signal is coming
           from!  Then hunt them down like dogs!
           Any and all Canadian influence must be
           stopped at all cost!

                     PRESIDENT
           Yes ma'am!

The President starts to run off.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           And Bill?

                     PRESIDENT
           Yes?

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           I'm needing lunch.

                     PRESIDENT
           Right away, ma'am!

The president runs off.

EXT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Establishing.

                     RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
           And so the draft will begin tomorrow, as
           more and more troops are needed to fight
           the Canadian forces...

INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Cartman's mother is tucking him into bed.

                     RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
           What is quickly being referred to as 'The
           Great Canadian-American War' has already
           reached a death toll of two million.

Cartman's mother reaches over and switches off the radio.

                     CARTMAN'S MOTHER
           Goodnight, honey.

                     CARTMAN
           Mom... When is the war gonna be over?

                     CARTMAN'S MOTHER
           I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You
           want it to end quickly, huh?

                     CARTMAN
           Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz
           all my favorite TV shows have been
           replaced by news and it's pissing me off.

                     CARTMAN'S MOTHER
           Oh.

With that, Cartman's mother gets up-

                     CARTMAN
           Mom...

                     CARTMAN'S MOTHER
           Yes, hon?

                     CARTMAN
           If you went down on a horse... You'd tell
           me, right?

                     CARTMAN'S MOTHER
           Sure, hon. Goodnight.

She switches off the light, and leaves.

Cartman lies there, lit only by soft, blue moonlight and
thinks.

He hears a SCRAPING noise, and looks a little scared, but
then tries to close his eyes to sleep.

                     CARTMAN
           Go away, scary noise.

Again the SCRAPING. Cartman pops open hs eyes to see -

KENNY! He is transparent and floating above Cartman's bed.

Cartman is horrified. Too much so to even scream.

Kenny puts his hands to his mouth to try and speak, but he
makes no sound.

Finally, Cartman lets out a piercing cry.

Cartman's mother comes running in, just as the image of Kenny
disappears.

                     CARTMAN'S MOTHER
           Eric?! Eric, what is it?!

                     CARTMAN
           I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!

Cartman's mother looks around and sees nothing. Finally, she
just cradles Cartman's fat head in her arms.

                     CARTMAN'S MOTHER
           Oh you poor dear. You've been through so
           much...

                     CARTMAN
           I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire
           and now he's all pissed off!!
               (BZZTZT!)
           AGH! I can't say pissed off?!
               (BAZZTZT!!)
           AGH!!

INT. HELL - DAY (MOVED)

Kenny is again snooping around. He quietly creaks Satan's
door open and walks in.

Satan is in his room, looking at a map of Earth.

                     SATAN
           The execution of Terrance and Phillip is
           imminent, soon all hell shall rise!!

Kenny looks scared.

                     SATAN
               (Evil and scary)
           Are you afraid, little one? Afraid for
           the souls of your pitiful friends that-

Suddenly, Saddam walks in carrying some bags.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Hey Satan!  I got some great new home
           furnishings today!

Satan rolls his eyes and sighs. His attempt to be evil to
Kenny is squashed again.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Boy buddy Rich, it was a bitch to get
           something to match with that bathroom
           tile!

Saddam looks at Kenny.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Oh, hey kid. Find those proofs of
           purchases yet? No?! Gee, whatta surprise!
           Well, keep lookin!

A beat. Satan folds his arms and looks at the floor, pissed.

                     SATAN
           Do you wanna know what I did today?

Saddam lets out a sigh.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           What did you do today Satan?

                     SATAN
           You don't care.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon
           thing has got you all stressed out. Let's
           make love.

                     SATAN
           Do you remember when you first got here?
           We used to talk all night long. Until the
           sun came up... We would just lie in bed
           and TALK.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           That's because I wanted to fuck you,
           dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those
           pants down!

                     SATAN
           Don't call me dumb!

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!

As this conversation happens, Kenny's eyes dart back and
forth as if watching a tennis match.

                     SATAN
           How come you always want to make love to
           me from behind? Is it because you want to
           pretend I'm somebody else?

Saddam sighs.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Satan, your ass is gigantic and red, who
           am I gonna pretend you are? Helen Reddy?

A beat.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Come on, kid. Help me with these shower
           curtains.

Saddam and Kenny walk out. Leaving Satan all alone with sad
music playing.

                     SATAN
               (Gently)
           Sometimes I think
           When I look up real high
           That there's a whole world up there
           And just maybe it could be mine
           But then, I sink
           because it's here I'm supposed to
           stay
           but I don't even know how or why
           its supposed to be that way-

Satan walks to his veranda.

                     SATAN
           Up there, there is so much room
           Where babies burp and flowers bloom
           Everyone dreams I can dream too
           Up there, Up where
           The skies are ocean blue
           I could be safe and live without a
           care... Up there

Satan walks over to a bright blue globe and spins it slowly.

                     SATAN
           They say I don't belong
           That my place is down below
           Because of my beliefs I'm supposed
           to stay where evil is sewn
           But what is evil anyway?
           Is there reason to the rhyme?
           Without evil there could be no good
           So it must be good to be evil
           sometimes
           Up there, there is so much room
           Where babies burp and flowers bloom.
           Everyone dreams I can dream too
           Up there, Up where
           The skies are ocean blue
           I could be safe and life without a
           care... Up there

PULL BACK, big crane shot rising above Satan.

EXT. SMALL ABANDONED BUILDING - NIGHT

A dim light is all that is visible from inside the small
building.

INT. LA RESISTANCE - NIGHT

Stan and Kyle are painting a sign on the wall 'La
Resistance'.

Cartman comes running in, he looks scared.

                     KYLE
           You're late, Cartman!

                     CARTMAN
           I had to ride my bike here. My behind is
           killing me.

                     KYLE
           Your behind?

                     CARTMAN
           I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if
           I say 'ass-
               (BBZZAATT)
           OW!!!

                     KYLE
           Did you bring the pie and punch?

                     CARTMAN
           No you guys... Something happened... You
           guys wanna hear something creepy?
               (Looking over each shoulder)
           I don't think Kenny is dead.

                     STAN
           What?

                     CARTMAN
           I saw him last night!

                     KYLE
           I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny
           every day.

                     CARTMAN
           YOU DO?!

                     KYLE
           Sure, dude.  On the face of every child,
           on the smile of every baby...

Kyle and Stan laugh again.

                     CARTMAN
           Hey!  I'm telling you this WAS Kenny! I
           think he's haunting me.

KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK!

The boys all look scared.

                     KYLE
           Somebody's here...

The boys walk over to the door, and open the sliding panel in
front of their eyes.

                     KYLE
           Who is it?

                     VOICE
           Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.

                     KYLE
           What's the password?

                     VOICE
           Uhh... I don't know.

                     KYLE
           Guess.

                     VOICE
           Uhh... Bacon.

                     KYLE
           Okay.

Kyle opens the door. The golden haired young boy from rehab
stands there looking handsome and angelic.

                     GREGORY
           Viva la Resistance.

                     STAN
           Oh no, it's that kid.

                     GREGORY
           This is the place--

Another kid walks up next to Gregory, it's Wendy. Stan's eyes
grow wide.

                     STAN
           Wendy?

                     WENDY
           Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?

                     GREGORY
           Well, apparently you have a bigger heart
           than we thought. Let us get this meeting
           underway, there are others coming.

Gregory takes Wendy's hand and pushes his way in. Stan fumes.

INT. LA RESISTANCE - LATER

Now the room is filled with a bunch of scared looking
RESISTANCE FOLLOWERS. All of whom are under the age of
twelve.

The room is lit only by candlelight. And the large 'VIVA LA
RESISTANCE' banner hands on the wall.

Stan and Kyle look nervous.

                     STAN
           Everyone be seated, please.

The kids all sit down.

                     KYLE
           Wow, a lot of people showed up.

                     STAN
           Yeah, so what do we say?

                     KYLE
           I thought you had something planned.

                     STAN
           Me?!

Stan looks out over the faces. Gregory checks his watch.

                     STAN
               (Nervous)
           Kay. Uh... Terrance and Phillip are
           supposed to be killed, and we think that
           sucks ass!!

The kids don't respond. Stan shoots a nervous look at Wendy,
who is sitting next to Gregory.

                     STAN
           Uhh... So we think we should prank call a
           bunch of policemen! We can have pizzas
           sent to them that they didn't order! VIVA
           LA RESISTANCE!!!

Again no response. Gregory rolls his eyes.

                     STAN
           Uhh...

Gregory stands up.

                     GREGORY
           May I?

                     STAN
           What?

Gregory takes Stan's place at the front of the group.

                     GREGORY
           Terrance and Phillip are currently being
           held at a Canadian Internment camp two
           kilometers outside of town.
           They are to be executed tomorrow during a
           star-studded USO show for the troops.

Gregory pulls a big map out of nowhere and rolls it out. Stan
and Kyle can't believe it.

                     GREGORY
           We must sneak into the camp through this
           duct, freeing Terrance and Phillip
           inside... The war is escalating, and the
           American forces are preparing for a large
           scale attack on Canada. That means the
           time is now...

                     KYLE
           Wow, dude, Wendy's new guy is smart.

Stan shoots Kyle a dirty look.

                     GREGORY
           This is a dangerous mission, so I'll go
           myself.

Wendy smiles at Gregory.

                     STAN
           No!

Everyone looks at Stan.

                     STAN
           WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to
           save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!

                     GREGORY
           This will be very dangerous... Are you
           quite sure?

                     CARTMAN
           Fuck that!
               (BZZT)
           AGAGH!!

                     STAN
           We're going... Let's run through the
           plan!!

INT. SOUTH PARK - AMERICAN ARMY HEADQUARTERS

A huge hall is filled with hundreds of soldiers in different
battalions.

We see our regulars: Mr. Garrison with a uniformed Mr. Hat,
Mr. Mackey, Jimbo and Ned, Bo, Pip, Stan's Grandfather,
Jesus, Officer Barbrady....

                     JIMBO
           Oh, I'm so glad there's a war again. I
           was gettin' worried I'd never see another
           one!

                     NED
           I know what you mean.

                     JIMBO
           And they're giving all us troops a big
           USO tomorrow with celebrities and
           executions!

PAN OVER to Mr. Garrison.

                     MR. GARRISON
           You look great in your new uniform Mr.
           Hat.

                     MR. HAT
           You do too, Mr. Garrison.

                     MR. GARRISON
           Boy, I can't wait for our first shore-
           leave so I can go get me some poontang.

Chef sits down in a seat behind Garrison near the back.

GENERAL PLYMKIN, a gruff old army type with bug eyes, steps
up to a podium and addresses the troops.

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           PAY ATTENTION!

The crowd settles down.

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           It's no secret that the Evil Canadian
           Federation has scored major victories all
           over the United State.  We have brought
           you here because you ar America's best,
           and last hope.

Another general leans over to Plymkin and whispers in his
ear.

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           Oh... Apparently you're not the best,
           you're simply the last. Anyway, let's
           strategize... Map!

A large, holographic 3-D map of South Park springs up in
front of him.  He walks around it pointing out things with a
laser-pointer.

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           Our sources have told us that the
           Canadians might try to attach tomorrow's
           USO show and stop us from executing
           Terrance and Phillip.

He points to a spot on the 3-D map.

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           Now each battalion has a specific code-
           name and mission.  Battalion 5, raise
           your hands-

Chef is in Battalion 5 and dutifully raises his hand.

Then he looks around and notices to his surprise that
everybody else in his section is also African American.

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           You will be the all-important first
           defense wave, which we will call
           'Operation Human Shield'.

                     CHEF
           Hey, wait a minute...

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           Now keep in mind, 'Operation Human
           Shield' will suffer heavy losses.  But
           don't lose your spirit men!  Stay until
           the bitter end.  Battalion 14?

A bunch of white guys raise their hands.

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           Right, you are 'Operation Get Behind The
           Darkies'.  You will follow Battalion 5
           here-

He points to a spot on the 3-D map.

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           -and try not to get killed for God's
           Sake.  Are there any questions men?

Chef raises his hand.

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           Yes soldier?

                     CHEF
           Have you ever heard of the Emancipation
           Proclamation?

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           I don't listen to hip-hop.

Chef scowls.

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           If you somehow live, we will regroup on
           this hill outside--

Suddenly, the 3-D hologram starts to flicker and fizzle.

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           Now what's wrong with this thing?

General Plymkin messes with the controls.

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           Fucking windows 98!

General Plymkin has pulled the plug. He stands there with
the cord in his hands.

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           GET GATES IN HERE!!!

BILL GATES walks in, escorted by two MILITARY GUARDS.

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           YOU TOLD US WINDOWS 98 WOULD BE FASTER
           AND MORE EFFICIENT WITH BETTER ACCESS TO
           THE INTERNET!!!

                     BILL GATES
           It is faster, over five million--

Plymkin pulls out a gun and shoots him in the head. Gates
falls to the floor, dead.

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           Alright men, get lots of rest, and
           prepare thyselves for battle!

INT. LA RESISTANCE - NIGHT

In the dead of night, the kids are all in a circle discussing
the plan.

                     GREGORY
           ...after you clear this zone here,
           rendezvous behind this ridge where
           Terrance and Phillip should be held.

                     KYLE
           Gotcha.

                     GREGORY
           You are indeed brave, but you will need
           someone who's done this sort of thing
           before.  MOLE!

Suddenly, a bump in the ground starts to move forward, leaving
a trail behind it. (like bugs bunny before he pops out)

The bump comes to a stop at the children's feet and out pops
THE MOLE.  He is a very bitter little nine year old French
kid with a THICK French accent.

                     VOICE
           Oui?

                     GREGORY
           Thank you for coming, Mole.

                     THE MOLE
           So... We must free more Canadian
           prizoners?

                     KYLE
           Yeah, I guess.

                     THE MOLE
           America... She iz a beetch that sheets on
           her own children.

Stan and Kyle look at each other confused.

                     GREGORY
           This is the Mole.  He will accompany you
           to the prison where Terrance and Phillip
           are.  He is an expert in covert
           operations and a lifelong fighter for
           freedom.

                     THE MOLE
           Freedom... It's like cow's urine poured
           down your troat. You wonder 'Do I want
           this?' I'm thersty... But it's urine.

Everyone stares at The Mole.

                     GREGORY
           Good luck Stan, I'll make sure Wendy
           is... kept safe?

Stan gets pissed.

                     KYLE
           Give me Terrance and Phillip or give me
           death!!!

                     OTHERS
           YEA!!!

Now, Gregory breaks into song. His voice is absolutely
gorgeous and deep. He puts his hand on Stan's shoulder.

                     GREGORY
           God has smiled upon you this day
           The fate of a nation in your
           hands...

Stan and Kyle look at each other. They can't believe how good
this guy's voice is. Wendy appears enthralled.

                     GREGORY
           As brothers and sisters we unite
           And behind you we shall fight!
           Until only the most righteous
           belief stands!

The music builds. Gregory gets up on a soapbox.

                     GREGORY
           Do you see the distant flames?
           they bellow in the night
           Fight in all our names
           For what we know is right
           And if you all get shot and cannot
           carry on
           Though you die, La Resistance
           lives on!

                     KYLE
           What? Shot?

Kyle and the boys look a little worried, as other kids join
in the song.

                     KIDS
           You might get stabbed in the head
           by a dagger or a sword
           You might be burned to death
           or skinned alive or worse!

                     GREGORY
           But when they torture you
           You will not feel a need to run
           For though you die, La Resistance
           Lives on!

                     KIDS
           Do you hear the beating drum?
           It is our hearts all joined to one
           It is the music of our souls
           knowing we have much to overcome!

As THE SONG CONTINUES we-

EXT. USO SHOW - NIGHT

The MAC Mothers are on a stage, preparing two electric
chairs.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Something must be done!
           Tomorrow it will be!
           We're going to execute this threat
           to our democracy!

All the mothers join in as they decorate the chairs with
American flags. Kenny's mother is counting money she has made
from selling t-shirts.

                     M.A.C. MOTHERS
           And after that our kids will be
           safe from all the Canadian scum!
           The time is now the time is here
           Tomorrow something will be done!

The song still CONTINUES as we

EXT. HELL - CONTINUOUS

Satan stands on his veranda.

                     SATAN
           I want to be part of that world!
           But if only I had the strength to
           go without HIM...
           If only I had the strength to leave
           him behind...
           Get on with my life in that
           world...
           Start over as part of that world...

INT. MILITARY BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS

The soldiers, including Garrison, Mackey, Ned and Jimbo are
in their bunks.

                     SOLDIERS
           Tomorrow we face our destiny!
           Tomorrow we fight to keep our
           country free!
           Death to Canada! Death to them all!
           Like our forefathers we shall
           answer the call!

PAN DOWN to Chef's bunk where he is lying naked with a hot
chick. As usual, Chef sings a song that has absolutely no
relevance to what's going on.

                     CHEF
               (Stroking woman's arm)
           Baby your thighs sparkle like
           diamonds
           Baby your butt is tender like the
           night
           I can see by the look in your pants
           that you want to treat me right.
           I'll whisper sweet nothings in your
           cleavage
           And you can kiss me gently with
           your tongue
           And I'll make love to you so deeply
           That you'll feel pressure clear up
           to your lungs.

Meanwhile, the soldiers continue their song.

                     SOLDIERS
           Something must be done!
           Something's gotta give!
           Tomorrow we will be free or we will no
           longer live!

INT. MILITARY PRISON - CONTINUOUS

Terrance and Phillip are chained to the wall in a dark, dirty
prison cell. Two armed American soldiers are torturing
Terrance and Phillip with hot irons, as Terrance and Phillip
sing-

                     TERRANCE & PHILLIP
           Shut your fucking face Unclefucka!
           You're an ass raping cock sucking
           Unclefucka!!!

EXT. LA RESISTANCE - CONTINUOUS

The kids are all gathered together, finishing their song.

One kid grabs a large flag and starts swirling it around.

                     KIDS
           Let it echo through the night!
           Let it reach the ears of everyone!
           Though we die

                                                    FADE OUT.

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE

All the South Park men are in the rank and file marching down
the street.

                     OFFICER
               (Singing)
           I don't know but I've been told-

                     SOLDIERS
           I DON'T KNOW BUT I'VE BEEN TOLD!

They pass Kyle's house.

INT. KYLE'S HOUSE - ATTIC

Ike watches the soldiers march from his little attic window.

                     OFFICER (O.S.)
           Canadian pussy is mighty cold!

                     SOLDIERS (O.S.)
           CANADIAN PUSSY IS MIGHTY COLD!

Ike blinks.  Does he understand them? he picks up a small
book and starts to write in it.

INT. HELL - DAY

Satan paces back and forth in hell.

                     SATAN
           This is it! World War Three is at hand!
           The millennium nears!

Satan crosses to one of his small demons.

                     SATAN
           Prepare the minions for the rising of
           Gothos!

The demon dashes off.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           This is so exciting! Let's fuck!

Satan sighs and bows his head.

                     SATAN
           This is the millennium, Saddam! This is
           Armageddon! There's more to life than
           sex!

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Hey, relax guy!

                     SATAN
           Well I just want you to be impressed with
           what I do. I want you to respect my MIND.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           I DO respect your mind! It turns me on!
           It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of
           you! Don't you see?

MUSIC BEGINS.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
               (Singing)
           Hey guy, relax, put out
           You gotta put out for me!
           I'm just a man with needs
           And right now I need your
           generosity!
           I love your eyes, your nose and
           lips
           So drop those pants and do some
           dips
           Come on guy, you gotta relax
           relax, put out for me!

Kenny looks confused.

                     SATAN
           What if I, don't wanna put out?
           That's all you ever say
           Relax put out
           I'm a living creature, I have
           feelings too, I don't need this
           abuse from you-

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Hey, guy, relax, put out!
           You gotta relax, shut your mouth-
           Baby I'd do anything for ya!
           Now don't make me smack you in the
           eye like last time-

Kenny keeps watching as Saddam throws on a Shakey's hat and
does a quick softshoe. Satan rolls his eyes.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           I get what I want, and what I want
           is for youuuuu toooo put ooooout!!!

Saddam finishes the song and Satanhangs his head.

                     SATAN
           What if I just left?

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides,
           you know that if you left me, I'd hunt
           you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna
           go grab a drink.

Saddam leaves. Satan looks about to cry, but then notices
Kenny still standing there.

                     SATAN
           What are you doing?! Get on with your
           misery!

                     KENNY
           Mph rmph rm rmph rm?

                     SATAN
           Him? I don't know... He can be nice...
           sometimes.

                     KENNY
           Mph rmph rm rmph rm.

                     SATAN
           What do you mean?! I could leave him if I
           wanted to!

                     KENNY
           Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.

Satan lowers his head. Slowly he starts to cry. Kenny walks
over and pats him on the back.

EXT. MILITARY COMPOUND

Tents and makeshift buildings are lined up against the
mountains.  Jeeps and Tanks buzz to and fro.

There's a huge stage which is set up with thousands of seats.
There's a giant banner reading "USO SHOW TONIGHT!!!!!"

Loads of soldiers file into their seats.

                     ANNOUNCER
           Alright you men! The USO show is about to
           start!!

The military men go wild.

                     ANNOUNCER
           Get ready for loads of entertainment and
           fabulous celebrities! To be followed
           immediately by the swift and nasty
           execution of Terrance and Elroy!

The crowd goes crazy again.

EXT. INTERNMENT CAMP - BEHIND THE USO SHOW - DUSK

Right out of Nazi Germany.  Barbed wire, guards, the whole
bit.

ANGLE ON BOYS

They are on their backs, shimmying along the ground
underneath the blanket of razor-wire that is set up around
the camp.

The Mole uses the bolt-cutters to cut the wire as he goes,
clearing a path for Stan, Kyle and Cartman.

                     THE MOLE
           Be careful not to touch this wire-

A wire catches on Cartman's arm and SNAPS against his face.

                     CARTMAN
           OW!  MOTHERFUCKER!

BZZAAAAT!!!

                     CARTMAN
           FUC-

Stan shoves his hand over Cartman's mouth, leaving Cartman to
cuss bloody murder into Stan's glove.

                     CARTMAN
           MPHMPH MPHMPHMPH!!!

BZAAT!

                     CARTMAN
           MMMPPPHHH!!!

Finally they clear the fence and lie down in view of the
camp.

                     THE MOLE
           It sounds like the USO show has started.
           We have precious little time...

Kyle looks at the horrible concentration camp.

                     KYLE
           Oh my God...

                     THE MOLE
           God? ...Let me tell you something about
           God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.

Kyle looks at The Mole, oddly.

                     STAN
           How are we ever gonna find them?

The Mole whips out some night vision goggles.

ANGLE ON INTERMENT CAMP THROUGH NIGHT VISION GOGGLES

The Mole inspects the camp.  He sees a guard on a guard
tower.  Then he pans over to a bunch of Canadians standing
in a line in rags.

The Mole quickly clicks the magnification to high so we see
the saddened faces of the Canadians.

                     KYLE
           Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and
           Phillip?

                     THE MOLE
           No. Zey must have zem inside. We will
           have to dig.

                     KYLE
           That's gonna take a long time!

                     THE MOLE
           Time? Did time matter to the
           Revolutionists who were forced to eat
           their own shit while dying in the
           dungeons of ze King?

The boys think.

EXT. USO SHOW - DAY

Helicopters zoom over the makeshift stage like the USO show
in Apocalypse Now.

Groups of soldiers cheer as a helicopter approaches the
landing platform and touches down.  The US army men cheer.

The mothers take the stage, and Kyle's mother speaks into the
microphone. Behind her is a huge American flag. She is
wearing an army helmet. This is right out of 'Patton'.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Ladies and gentlemen of the American war
           effort, we salute you!

A big cheer goes through the crowd. Kyle's mother feels the
power, and lifts her head high. She starts to pace back and
forth on the stage as she speaks, becoming more and more
Pattonlike.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Tomorrow you will be risking your lives
           so that our children will have a better
           future... God bless you men. And God
           bless this filth free nation. Many of you
           will die. Die like blood bathed pigs.  So
           tonight, we at MAC present a NIGHT OF A
           HUNDRED STARS! Now without further ado, I
           give you...

Out of the helicopter emerge a battalion of the best and
brightest stars that the American show biz industry has to
offer.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Pint size pixie and darling of the indie
           movie scene, Winona Ryder!

She gestures grandly to the helicopter where Winona Ryder
emerges and runs to center stage and waves to the audience.
She looks like a strung out coke addict; because she is.

                     WINONA RYDER
           Hi guys!  I'm T.V.'s Winona Ryder!

One guy claps.

                     WINONA RYDER
           I want you all to know I'm super psyched
           to be here today.  You guys rock.  What
           you're doing for our country so sooo
           cool.  It's so real.  I've been acting
           since I was twelve and I can't
           distinguish between make believe and real
           life.

Winona falls down. But gets back up immediately.

                     WINONA RYDER
           And then I confuse me real life with my
           big-screen one.  And sure, people get
           hurt, and I'm sorry about that but
           Christ, look at me.  It's not my fault
           that I can get any guy I want.  And
           that's reality to me.  But you guys...
           wow.  I mean, war, man. Fucking war.  It
           doesn't get any more real--  Now, this
           one goes out to you.

She cues the band which has been assembled from the same
helicopter.  Jazz music starts up.

It's 'New York, New York'. The troops look confused.

                     WINONA RYDER
           You know what I'm gonna do for you now,
           don't you?

'New York, New York' continues to play.

                     WINONA RYDER
           WRONG!
               (Singing)
           The bells are ringin'
           For me and my gal!
           The birds are singin'
           For me and my gal!-

INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - BELOW THE USO SHOW

The mole is digging frantically while the boys follow on all
fours.  Cartman holds a flashlight.

                     CARTMAN
           Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't
           know we were gonna get all dirty and
           stuff.

                     THE MOLE
           Sheet!

                     STAN
           What is it?

                     THE MOLE
           Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis
           direction!

                     STAN
           We're going to die here like baby mice
           who have had no milk in days.  Dry up
           into crunchy little pinkies.

The boys stare.

A beat.

                     THE MOLE
           Or, we can dig UP.

The mole starts digging up towards the ground.

EXT. INSIDE THE PRISON CAMP

Mole pops his head out of the ground. Immediately, a search
light passes over the hole.

                     THE MOLE
           Sheet!

Mole ducks, just avoiding the light.

Slowly, the boys' heads appear from the hole.

The whole camp is in front of them.  There is a HUGE
barbedwire fence on one side (the side they just dug from)  A
dozen armed guards with huge Dobermans patrol the grounds with
Howitzers.  It doesn't look good.

                     THE MOLE
           Move! Move!

One by one, The Mole, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman pop out of the
ground, and run for a nearby building.  Once at the building,
they all duck to avoid the search lights.

                     THE MOLE
           Okay.... The Americans must be holding
           Terrance and Phillip in one of those
           bunkers. We will split up here.  Let's
           synchronize watches!

The others look at each other.

                     KYLE
           We don't have watches.

A beat.

                     THE MOLE
           You don't have watches?

                     STAN
           Dude, you didn't say anything about
           watches.

                     THE MOLE
           What do you think this is kid?  Lick
           Barney the Dinosaur's pussy fucking
           kiddie hour?  Huh?  This is real life
           with consequences you take to the grave!

                     KYLE
           Dude, we don't have watches.

                     THE MOLE
           Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror?

                     STAN
           Got it.

                     THE MOLE
           And ze rope?

                     STAN
           Check.

                     THE MOLE
           And the butfor?

                     KYLE
           What's a butfor?

                     THE MOLE
           For pooping, silly.

A beat... Then mole takes a long drag off his cigarette and
slowly blows the smoke.

                     THE MOLE
           Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you
           stand watch here and await my return. If
           any guards come by, make a sound like a
           dying giraffe.

                     KYLE
           What's a dying giraffe sound like?

                     THE MOLE
               (Putting his hands to his
                mouth)
           Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.

                     KYLE
           Kay.

The Mole turns to Cartman.

                     THE MOLE
           Cartman, over zere, is the electrical
           box. You must sneak over zere and shut it
           off before I return with Terrance and
           Phillip or the alarms will sound and I
           will be shot full of holes. Got it?

                     CARTMAN
           Okay.

                     THE MOLE
           You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY
           IMPORTANT do you understa-

                     CARTMAN
           I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU
           FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!

Cartman storms off.

                     THE MOLE
           I will tunnel my way into ze buildings,
           and find ze prisoners.

The Mole starts to dig.

                     KYLE
           Be careful, dude.

                     THE MOLE
           Careful? Was my mother careful when she
           stabbed me in the heart with a clothes
           hanger while I was still in ze womb?

And with that, The Mole quickly starts to tunnel his way
underground.

                     STAN
           Damn, dude, that kid is fucked up.

EXT. STAGE - NIGHT

Back on stage at the USO show.  Winona Ryder is just
finishing up her song.

                     WINONA RYDER
               (Singing)
           ....It's a hell of a TOWN!  And
           that's my New York Melodyyyyyy!!!!

The band finishes with a flourish. Winona takes a bow.

One person in the entire audience claps.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Let's hear it again for the one and only
           Winona Ryder!!!

The same guy claps again.

                     ONE CLAPPING GUY
           We love you, Winona!

Everybody else in the audience just stares at him.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Next up we have a special treat...
           Please welcome, direct from Vegas- BIG
           GAY AL'S BIG GAY EXPERIENCE!!!

The place goes wild as Big Gay Al walks out on stage.  Winona
fumes in the wings.

                     RANDOM SOLDIER
           This guy is the coolest!

                     RANDOM SOLDIER 2
           Totally man!

The back curtain goes up to reveal a tropical jungle set
complete with a waterfall, hippos, monkeys and hundreds of
colorfully dressed dancers.

                     BIG GAY AL
           How we all feeling tonight?!

Between the cheering, we hear a throng of "Happy!". Now the
place is rocking!! Everybody loves Big Gay Al!

Winona can't believe it.

                     BIG GAY AL
           I can't hear you...

                     CROWD
           Happy!!!

                     BIG GAY AL
           Friends, you know why I'm here... I'm
           here to teach TOLERANCE!!

The crowd cheers.

                     BIG GAY AL
           I'm here to say that we're all PEOPLE
           under God, and we should embrace, and
           accept our differences!!

The crowd cheers louder.

                     BIG GAY AL
           And that means we should LOVE CANADIANS
           TOO!!

The entire place goes incredibly quiet.

You can hear a pin drop.

Silence...

Deafening silence...

                     BIG GAY AL
           JUST KIDDING!! FUCK 'EM!!!

Slow music swells in. Big Gay Al saunters around the stage
and starts to sing.

                     BIG GAY AL
               (Singing)
           Bombs are flying
           People are dying
           Children are crying
           Politicians are lying too
           Cancer is killing
           Texaco is spilling
           The whole world's gone to hell
           But how are you?

Suddenly, Big Gay Al is wearing a big feathery outfit and all
his dancers dash to his side.

                     BIG GAY AL
           I'm super!  Thanks for asking!
           All things considered I'm doing
           super
           I must say!
           Very peachee
           Nothing bugs me
           'Cause everything is super when
           you're
           -don't you think I look cute in
           this hat?

The crowd is absolutely confused.

                     BIG GAY AL
           I'm so sorry, Mr. Cripple
           But I just can't feel bad for you
           right now
           Because I'm feeling so insanely
           super
           That even seeing you in that chair
           can't bring me down!

EXT. INTERNMENT CAMP - ANOTHER AREA

Cartman is by himself, slowly moving from building to
building. He is scared out of his mind.

                     CARTMAN
               (Imitating the Mole)
           Shut of ze Power, Cartman. Zis is very
           important, Cartman... Stupid British
           piece of shi-
               (BAZZT!)
           OW!

He approaches the electrical box.  Just as he's about to open
it, two armed AMERICAN SOLDIERS round the corner.  Cartman
gets scared and hides in the shadows.  The soldiers continue
walking...

                     AMERICAN SOLDIER
           Dude, if I was gay, I'd be just like Big
           Gay AL!

                     AMERICAN SOLDIER 2
           Me too!!

...And pass a terrified Cartman.

EXT. INTERNMENT CAMP - STAN AND KYLE'S AREA

The boys are waiting, bored, for The Mole to return.

                     KYLE
           I don't think he's coming back, dude.

Just then, we hear The Mole return from his hole. He is
carrying the ticket guy from the movie theater.

                     TICKET GUY
           Oh thank you! Thank you for getting me
           out of there!! They locked me up for
           selling movie tickets to minors!

                     THE MOLE
           Is this one of zem?

                     KYLE
           No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!

                     THE MOLE
           Oh... Alright, back you go.

The Mole takes the Ticket Guy back through the hole.

                     TICKET GUY
           No! Please! I don't want to go back!!

The boys sit back down and wait again.

EXT. USO SHOW/STAGE - CONTINUOUS

Meanwhile, Big Gay Al's song continues-

                     BIG GAY AL
           I'm super! Thanks for asking!
           All things considered I'm doing
           better than okay!
           Feeling peaches
           nothing bugs me
           Everything is super when you're
           -don't you think I look cute in
           this hat and my little shoes and
           this matching tie that I got at
           Merv's?

The chorus guys all pick Big Gay Al up and dance around with
him on stage.

                     CHORUS
           He's super! Thanks for asking!
           All things considered he is better
           than okay!
           And it's peachee, nothing bugs him
           Everything is super when you're-
           Let's fight fight fight against
           Canada today!!!!!!

The song ends and everyone erupts into applause.

INT. HELL - DAY

Satan is looking into a large, oracle-like ball. Saddam isn't
around, but a few demons and Kenny are hanging out.

                     SATAN
           The execution is going to happen any
           moment... We must prepare.

The demons make excited noises.

                     KENNY
           Mph rmph rm!

                     SATAN
           Get everyone in hell ready. When the
           blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the
           day is ours!

Two of the demons head for Satan's room.

                     SATAN
           No! Not Saddam. Don't wake him... Uh...
           I'll tell him...

Satan walks to the bedroom.

EXT. INTERNMENT CAMP - ELECTRICAL BOX AREA

Cartman approaches the electrical box nervously -- looking
all around for soldiers.

He opens the door to the electrical box and sees a large
switch labeled ON and OFF.  He reaches to turn off the switch
when he feels a tap on his shoulder.

Cartman jumps.

                     CARTMAN
           Agh!!!

Then turns and karate-chops in one spastic flurry to see -
KENNY!!

                     CARTMAN
           Son of a gun!  HECK!

Kenny's ghost is again floating in front of Cartman. Kenny
again struggles to speak.

                     CARTMAN
           GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN
           FAULT!

                     KENNY
           Mph rmprmmh rm!!

                     CARTMAN
           I don't have proofs of purchases from
           Snacky Smores, Kenny!

                     KENNY
           MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!

                     CARTMAN
           AGAGAH!!

Cartman runs off, leaving the power completely on.

INT. KYLE'S HOUSE - ATTIC - NIGHT

Ike is still just sitting quietly in the dark attic.

Suddenly, the attic door bursts open!

                     AMERICAN SOLDIER
           Found one!

Other soldiers file into the attic and grab Ike by the arms.

                     AMERICAN SOLDIER
           Yep, that's a Canadian alright.

                     IKE
           Sibi mammama.

The American Soldier picks up Ike.

                     AMERICAN SOLDIER
           So, thought you could hide from us, did
           you?! Take him away!

The soldiers drag Ike down the stairs.

                     AMERICAN SOLDIER 2
           Sir, look at this!
               (Holding up a book)
           He was writing some kind of diary...

                     AMERICAN SOLDIER
           Diary?  What does it say?

                     AMERICAN SOLDIER 2
               (Reading)
           Cookie monster.  Banana.

Sweeping, moving MUSIC STING.

EXT.  INTERNMENT CAMP - STAN AND KYLE'S AREA

Kyle is patiently awaiting Mole's return.

                     KYLE
           Damn it! Come on, Mole we're running out
           of time!

Kyle spins around when he hears someone coming.

But it's only Cartman. He's panting heavily.

                     CARTMAN
           You guys! Seriously! You guys!

                     KYLE
           What Cartman?!

                     CARTMAN
           Kenny! I saw Kenny again!

                     STAN
           Oh, brother.

                     KYLE
           Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?

Cartman stops breathing heavily and thinks.

                     KYLE
           Cartman?!

                     CARTMAN
           Whoops.

Just then, all the alarms in the place go off.

                     KYLE
           Oh shit!

From the distance, the boys hear gunshots.

Suddenly, the Mole pops out of the hole. The boys see that
The Mole has been shot up badly.

                     THE MOLE
           Ze alarms! Zey went off!

                     CARTMAN
           Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.

As SHOUTS and RUNNING FOOTSTEPS draw closer, The Mole lays
down and begins to die in Kyle's arms.

                     THE MOLE
           Please... Do not let ze resistance die...

Gentle MUSIC begins.

                     THE MOLE
           Now the light, she fades
           And darkness closes in
           But I will find strength
           I will find pride within
           Because although I die
           Our freedom will be won
           Though I die
           Ze Resistance
           Lives on...

The Music fades away, as the Mole coughs up some blood.

                     THE MOLE
           It's so very cold...

                     KYLE
           We can't leave without you!

                     THE MOLE
           It's okay, I am done for.

                     KYLE
           No, I mean WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT YOU -
           we don't know where the hell we are!!

The Mole coughs up more blood.

                     THE MOLE
           Where is your God when you need him?
           Where is your beautiful, merciful faggot
           now?

The Mole dies.

                     KYLE
           SHIT!

                     VOICE
           FREEZE!!

The boys look up to see three large MARINES pointing guns at
them.

Stan makes a run for it. He dashes off at full speed.

                     KYLE
           Run, Stan!!

One of the soldiers fires at him. PWANG! PWANG! But Stan
disappears into the night.

                     PENTAGON GUY
           Forget him! The night will swallow him
           up.

                     MARINE
           You are under arrest!  Cuff 'em!

                     KYLE
           What?

                     PENTAGON
           So THIS must be the resistance the
           pentagon has been tracking!

                     CARTMAN
           Oh, son of a bitch...

EXT. USO SHOW - NIGHT

Kyle's mother, and the other mothers of MAC, take the stage
again.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           And now, for our big finale, the MOMENT
           YOU HAVE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR!!!

Terrance and Phillip are wheeled out onto the stage.

                     TERRANCE
           Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.

                     PHILLIP
           I know, Terrance.  This is quite the
           shitstorm we've found ourselves in this
           time.

From the other side, Kyle's mom appears with a couple of
official looking military people.  The crowd cheers.

                     KYLE'S MOM
           It is my pleasure to present to you, THE
           EXECUTION OF TERRANCE AND PHILLIP!!!

The crowd cheers.

                     KYLE'S MOM
           Strap them in!

Terrance and Phillip are then greeted by the EXECUTIONER,
donned in a black hood.

The scary giant Executioner grabs Terrance and Phillip and
puts them into electric chairs.

                     KYLE'S MOM
           Today is a great day for democracy!

The crowd cheers.

The Executioner steps up to the throw switch.

                     TERRANCE
           Phillip, this is worse than that trip to
           Quebec City when I fell asleep in that
           disco.

                     PHILLIP
           I know, Terrance. I know.

EXT. SOMEWHERE IN SOUTH PARK - NIGHT

LONG SHOT of a desolate, dark area.

It has started to rain. Stan trudges through the wilderness
looking tired and scared.

                     STAN
           Hello? Where the hell am I? Is anybody
           here?

A few wolf HOWLS sound in the distance. Stan walks on.

                     STAN
           MARCO!!!

No answer.

                     STAN
           MARCO!!!

No answer. Stan stumbles a bit.

                     STAN
           Dude, weak... Can't go on... Dizzy...

Stan falls to the ground. His face plops in the rainy mud and
his head smacks against a rock.

Stan is out cold.

Just then, a strange sound emerges. It is like a pulsating
WOBBLE. Stan slowly awakes, picks up his head and shines his
flashlight around.

                     STAN
           What is that?

The sound gets louder. Stan shines his flashlight on
something that is huge and throbbing.

                     STAN
           OH MY GOD!!!

EXT. STAGE - NIGHT

Kyle's mother approaches Terrance and Phillip.

                     KYLE'S MOM
           Gentlemen, do you have any last words?

                     PHILLIP
           Last words? Let's see... How aboot "GET
           ME THE FUCK OUT OF THIS CHAIR". How's
           that for last words?

Kyle's mom nods to the Executioner.

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           WAIT!!

General Plymkin walks out next to Kyle's mother.

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           We have just captured some Canadian
           Sympathizers!

The crowd cheers. Kyle's mother smiles.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           We will execute them along with Terrance
           and Phillip for your viewing pleasure!

Another cheer. The mothers are all very pleased. That is,
until they see Kyle and Cartman brought out to the stage at
gunpoint.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Kyle?!

                     CARTMAN'S MOTHER
           Eric?

                     KYLE
           Hi, ma.

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           We also have a Canadian SPY who was
           hiding out in South Park!!

Now Ike is brought out at gunpoint.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Ike?!

Kyle's mother rushes over to General Plymkin.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           General... These are OUR CHILDREN!

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           They are Canadian sympathizers and they
           must be dealt with accordingly!

                     STAN'S MOTHER
           But they're CHILDREN!

Cartman walks over to where Terrance and Phillip are strapped
into their chairs.

                     CARTMAN
           Dude! Terrance and Phillip! Wow! Can I
           get your autographs?!

                     TERRANCE
           Sure, tubby, just as soon as we're
           killed.

                     KENNY'S MOTHER
           We can't kill these kids!

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           Listen mothers, YOU'RE the ones that
           started all this. Don't get all emotional
           NOW!

                     STAN'S MOTHER
           But we're doing all this to help our
           children's futures!

                     CARTMAN'S MOTHER
           Yes, I think shooting our children would
           adversely affect their futures.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           No... The General is right.

                     KYLE
           MOM!!!

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Boobie... This is the only way you're
           ever going to learn. I have an
           opportunity here to teach you about
           consequences.

                     STAN'S MOTHER
           Sheila, you're going to far! Those are
           YOUR children!

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO
           BE RUINED BY SMUT!!
               (To Kyle)
           I am sorry young man, but I have had it
           up to here! STRAP THEM IN!

She walks away.

                     KYLE
           YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR
           LANGUAGE!!

EXT. IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - NIGHT

Stan is still lying in mud, but now he lies before a HUGE,
pulsating, organic looking thing that belongs in the X-Files.
It's the size of a small building.

The massive thing starts to glow. Stan looks weak and afraid.

                     BIG THING
           Be not afraid...

Stan trembles.

                     STAN
               (Weakly)
           What...

                     BIG THING
           Behold my glory.

                     STAN
           What... are you?

                     BIG THING
           I am the clitoris.

Stan's eyes grow wide. MUSIC starts to swell up.

                     STAN
           The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE
           CLITORIS!!

                     BIG THING
           Stan, your friends need you. They are in
           trouble and you must help them.

                     STAN
           Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to
           get Wendy to like me.

                     BIG THING
           There are more important matters right
           now...

                     STAN
           NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR
           YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO
           GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!

                     BIG THING
           Dude, she's eight years old, just get her
           some ice cream or something.

                     STAN
           Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!

                     BIG THING
           Now go, your friends are in danger... The
           USO show is a mile east of here, just
           over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.

The clitoris fades, and just as it does, all the kids of La
Resistance come running into frame. Wendy and Gregory are
with them as well.

                     WENDY
           Stan! Stan are you okay?!

                     STAN
           Wendy?

                     GREGORY
           I see you failed in your mission.
           Terrance and Phillip must be dead by now.

Wendy bends down to pick up Stan.

                     WENDY
           Come on Stan, we have to hurry. The
           Canadian forces are about to attack!!

Wendy pulls Stan up off the ground and slings his arm around
her.

EXT. USO SHOW - NIGHT

A drummer plays as the execution begins.

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           We begin with Terrance and Phillip!!!
           Throw the switch!!!

The executioner throws the switch and Terrance and Phillip
start to fry. Kyle, Cartman and Ike, in their chairs, look
horrified.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Goodbye, bastards!

Near death, Terrance cranks out a weak fart. Terrance and
Phillip both laugh weakly but merrily.

                     TERRANCE
           Take that, bitch.

As Terrance and Phillip fry, they scream out:

                     PHILLIP/TERRANCE
           FREEEEEEDOMMMMM!!!

Suddenly, FWWOOOMMM!!! A Bomb lands in the middle of the
army. BLAM!! It explodes with incredible force, sending dead
bodies in all directions.

Canadian military planes zoom overhead! It's a full scale
attack!!

From a HIGH ANGLE we see the soldiers all scatter like bugs
in every direction.

                     MR. GARRISON
           THE CANADIANS ARE ATTACKING!! RUN FOR
           YOUR LIVES!!

FWWOOMM!!! BLAMM!! Another explosion!  Everybody just starts
screaming and shooting in every direction.  Total and
complete mayhem.

One explosion knocks out the electricity, and Terrance and
Phillip stop drying.

The electricity runs along a wire, across the stage, and
right up Cartman's leg. Cartman starts frying horribly.

                     KYLE
           CARTMAN!

                     CARTMAN
               (Frying)
           WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!!

                     PHILLIP
           What's going on Terrance?

                     TERRANCE
           Canada is saving us!!

Finally, Cartman is blown clear of the electricity. Kyle
picks him up and starts to run along with Ike.

INT. HELL - SATAN'S BEDROOM

Satan opens the door to find Saddam sleeping happily in his
cozy bed. He is only wearing little black g-string panties.

                     SATAN
               (Whispering)
           Have you finished?

Now we see that Kenny is standing at the foot of the bed. He
holds a gasoline can, and has just finished pouring the last
drops underneath the bed.

                     KENNY
           Mph mph.

                     SATAN
           Then move out of the way.

Kenny walks over next to Satan. Satan pulls out a book of
matches.

                     SATAN
           I must be strong... I must be strong...

Satan tries to light the match. It won't light.

                     SATAN
           Damn it...

Finally, the match lights. Satan holds it up-

                     SATAN
           Goodbye, Saddam...

-and throws it onto the bed.

                     SATAN
           Come on!

Saddam burns to a crisp and Satan and Kenny run out.

EXT. USO SHOW - DAY

People run screaming in all directions as a full scale attack
has broken out. Gunfire, explosions and dead bodies fly all
around.

                     JIMBO
           Ned!  Behind you!

Ned whips around and mows down a line of Canadians. But one
Canadian makes it through, and sticks his bayonet through
Ned's neck.

Blood gushes from Ned's neck as he collapses.

                     JIMBO
           NED!!! NOOOOOOO!!!!!

FWWOOM!! BLAMMM!!! The boys runs as fast as they can amidst
the explosions.

                     CARTMAN
           HOLY SHIT!
               (Zap)
           AGHAGHGAH!!

Now when the V-chip shocks Cartman, we can actually see the
blue current swirl around his body.

                     CARTMAN
           HEY! THIS V-CHIP IS GETTING ALL SCREWY!!

General Plymkin has followed his men into the trench, where
explosions and gunfire fly all around. He pulls out a walkie
talkie as his men die all around him.

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           ALRIGHT MEN!!!  FALL INTO FORMATION!
           "HUMAN SHIELD" UP FRONT THEN "OPERATION
           GET BEHIND THE DARKIES"!!!

They all fall in.  A phalanx of black men, Chef included in
them, walk out in front of a bunch of white guys.

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           REMEMBER, HUMAN SHIELD!  PROTECT OUR
           TANKS AND PLANES, TOO!

Just then, over a ridge in front of them, a line of Canadian
tanks appears. The tanks are lined up 3 deep.  Behind them is
a line of missile launchers.  General Plymkin's jaw drops.

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           Holy Mother of Johosephat...

The black guys all look at each other nervously.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD

The boys run through the chaos.  Body parts and scrapnel fly
here and there.

A bloody soldier suddenly stumbles and falls in front of the
boys holding a massive head wound.

                     KYLE
           Hey! It's Mr. Garrison!!

Garrison lies on the ground, coughing up blood.

                     MR. GARRISON
           Children... Take Mr. Hat... Please... Get
           him out of here...

Garrison takes Mr. Hat off his hand and gives it to Cartman.

Just then, Garrison goes limp.

Cartman looks at the Mr. Hat in his hand and scowls. The boys
run from the battle.

They pass the American troops, where all the black guys are
standing in a human shield around the white guys.

                     CHEF
           Alright, squad... JUST LIKE I TOLD YOU...
           ONE!!

The Canadian tanks take aim.

                     CHEF
           TWO!

The Canadian tanks fire.

                     CHEF
           THREE!!

All the black guys suddenly jump out of the way, leaving the
whites completely exposed.

                     GENERAL PLYMKIN
           What the-

The tank fire hits the army, blowing all the white soldiers
to smithereens, including Ned and Jimbo.

                     BLACK SOLDIER
           GREAT PLAN, CHEF!

                     CHEF
           Operation Human Shield my ASS!

EXT. SOUTH PARK - DAY

From an EXTREME WIDE SHOT, we see all the forces on both
sides exchange firepower. The Canadian National anthem can be
heard in the distance.

We see Mr. Mackey looking like a natural born killer.  He
shoots like a maniac into the Canadians.  He wounds one and
then marches over to the wriggling body with a knife.

                     MR. MACKEY
           Die Canadian, mmkay?!

And he drives the knife into the Canadian's chest.

But then, suddenly, another Canadian Soldier appears out of
nowhere, and blows a hole through Mackey's chest.

                     MR. MACKEY
           Mkay-

Mackey falls to the ground, dead. Just then Big Gay Al runs
through the frame, we FOLLOW him as he skips his way around
gunfire.

                     BIG GAY AL
           Ooh! Goodness those bullets are going
           FAST!!!

Another bullet zings by his head.

                     BIG GAY AL
           Jumping Jesus, this is insane!!

THUMP! A bullet hits Big Gay Al square in the head. More
bullets follow, tearing him to shreds.

WIDE ANGLE ON - ENTIRE BATTLE

This shot parodies one of the big shots from 'Saving Private
Ryan'. Just complete overkill. Explosions, helicopters,
gunfire and death.

Kyle's mother, and the other mothers as well, stand on a
ridge overlooking the horrific massacre.

                     STAN'S MOTHER
           My God... This is terrible...

Kyle's mother holds out her M-16. She is now completely
insane.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           This is what we wanted! We wanted our
           children to be brought up in a smut-free
           environment!!!

                     KENNY'S MOTHER
           But we didn't want THIS. I just followed
           you 'cause I made a shitload of money
           selling Kenny t-shirts!

                     STAN'S MOTHER
           Oh Lord, what have we done...?

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Wake up, people!  We all have to do
           things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's
           the not pretty things that make life
           worth fighting the not pretty things for!
           Why do you think children have to be born
           in hospitals?

The other mothers look very confused.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Why does it matter?! My plan is a perfect
           plan!!  Perfect!  Perfect! Perfect!!!!!

The other mothers walk away.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the
           not pretty things from letting our
           children be born in hospitals!

                     STAN'S MOTHER
           We're going to find our boys! For God's
           sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!

Kyle's mother turns back to the battle. More killing and
explosions.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Killed.  They should only be so lucky.
           Kyle wasn't even BORN in a hospital!

She charges the field.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS

Terrance and Phillip are dodging gunfire and super loud
explosions.

                     PHILLIP
           Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!

                     TERRANCE
           You did? Just now?

They laugh merrily.

                     PHILLIP
           Come on, we can take shelter in one of
           those buildings!

But just then, Kyle's mother comes charging in with her gun!!

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           AAAGHGAHGHGH!!! YOU DESTROYED MY
           FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!

Phillip spins around just in time to see Kyle's mother
plunge her bayonet into Terrance's abdomen.

                     TERRANCE
           AGH!

                     PHILLIP
           Terrance! NO!

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           DIE!!!!!!

SLOW MOTION SHOT -

Blood from Terrance's abdomen slowly spills from his stomach.

Everything gets SILENT as we follow the blood down, down,
down...

Until it hits the ground with a huge, echoing BWOOOMMMM!!!

CLOSE UP on Kyle's mother's eyes.

CLOSE UP on the spot of blood on the ground...

BACK TO REAL TIME

Suddenly, the ground starts to open up! FWOOM!! Great flames
and ash take over the sky.

Satan and his minions explode from below. Everyone stops
fighting for a moment, to watch this amazing spectacle.

                     SATAN
           RAAGHGH!!!! MY TIME HAS COME!!!

Demons and flames emerge from the ground. All the soldiers on
both sides can't believe what they're seeing.

Now out of the giant abyss comes Kenny. He dusts himself off
and looks around.

EXT. TRENCH - NIGHT

As more bombs and gunshots go off. Kyle, Cartman and Ike
huddle close to each other in a trench.

                     CARTMAN
           Kyle... All those times I said you were a
           big dumb Jew... I didn't mean it. You're
           not a Jew.

Kyle thinks.

                     KYLE
           Yes I am!

                     IKE
           Baba mama!

Another explosion rocks the trench. Dirt flies all over the
boys' heads.

                     CARTMAN
           AGH!
               (Noticing Mr. Hat in his hand)
           What the hell am I still holding this
           for?!

Cartman tosses Mr. Hat out of the trench. We hear GUNSHOTS
and then VERY FAINTLY we hear Garrison's voice.

                     MR. GARRISON
           Mr. Hat! Noooooo!

Suddenly, Stan jumps down into the trench.

                     KYLE
           Stan!

                     STAN
           Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can
           get Wendy to like me now!

                     KYLE
           Sweet.

                     CARTMAN
               (Sarcastic)
           Oh, that's swell, Stan. I guess all's
           well that ends well, huh? We can go home
           now. There's just one little thing left
           to tie up... WORLD WAR THREE!!!

More explosions go off. Dead bodies fly all around the boys.

Suddenly, Kenny appears before the boys.

                     CARTMAN/KYLE
           AGAGAH!!!

                     CARTMAN
           It's him! I told you!! Kenny's come to
           take us to the netherworld!

                     KENNY
           Mph rmph rmph rmph?!

                     KYLE
           Wait! He's not haunting us, he's trying
           to tell us something!

                     KENNY
           Mph rmph rm rmph rm!

                     CARTMAN
           Okay!  We can get you some proofs of
           purchases for Snacky Smores Kenny!  Just
           mellow the heck out!

EXT. SOMEWHERE IN SOUTH PARK - NIGHT

More battle. People are dying left and right.

The Doctor from the Hospital scene runs in with an M-16. A
Canadian steps in front of him, the doctor shoots, and blows
the Canadian's head clean off.

                     DOCTOR GAUCHE
           Hey, pal, don't lose your head.

Suddenly, the ticket guy's chest rips open. He falls dead,
and standing behind him is a Canadian with a double barreled
shotgun.

                     CANADIAN SOLDIER
           I'm glad you got that off your chest.

Tom the Rhinoplasty surgeon leaps in and stabs the Canadian
through the head with his bayonet.

                     TOM
           I guess he got the point.

A Canadian rushes in and machine guns Tom full of holes.

                     CANADIAN SOLDIER 2
           Plastics are a cheap and efficient
           insulator for electrical applications.

Just as the fighting escalates, Satan and his minions rush
in.

                     SATAN
           Yes! Good! Fight and kill one another!

The soldiers all look scared and puzzled.

                     SATAN
           You're all part of Satan's army now!

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           What the hell is going on?!

Satan gets in Kyle's mother's face.

                     SATAN
           I am the dark master!

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I
           don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!

                     SATAN
           SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Oh.

                     SATAN
           YOU HAVE SPILLED THE BLOOD OF THE
           INNOCENTS. NOW THE WORLD BELONGS TO ME...
           NOW BEGINS TWO MILLION YEARS OF
           DARKNESS!!  AND ALL THANKS TO YOU!!!

Kyle's mother backs down, ashamed.

                     CHEF
           Oh, good job, Mrs. Broflofski, thanks a
           lot.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           I... I was just trying to make the world
           a better place for children...

                     SATAN
           Yes... And in doing so, you brought
           enough anger and intolerance to the world
           to allow my coming.

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           And I thought my mother was the master of
           guilt.  Geez Louise.

                     SATAN
           SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO
           ME!!!

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Oh God... What have I done...

One by one, the soldiers start to kneel.

Satan throws his arms up in the air and laughs a horrible,
deep laugh that fills the world.

But just then, the ground shakes again. Satan looks over to
the huge abyss he had crawled out of and notices another
figure.

He is burnt horribly, but it is Saddam. He holds a martini
glass in his hand.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Hey, I'm missing the party!

                     SATAN
           No! It can't be!

Saddam, burnt to a crisp, walks over to Satan and grabs his
ass.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Did you miss me, buttercup?
               (Yelling out)
           All right, gang! I am your new ruler now!
           Everyone bow down to ME!!

Satan puts his head down.

                     KYLE
           HOLD EVERYTHING!!!

Kyle walks up with Cartman, Stan and Kenny.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Oh, it's the bratty kid from hell.

                     KYLE
           You made a deal with Kenny that if he got
           ten proofs of purchases from Snacky
           Smores you'd grant him any wish.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           And?

Kenny pulls out the proofs of purchases. TRIUMPHANT MUSIC
plays.

                     SATAN
           I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking
           with him!

                     KYLE
           What?

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           The deal's off, go away, guy.

                     SATAN
           No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't
           just renege on a deal. That's lying.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not
           hear okay?

Saddam smacks Satan in the face. Now Satan looks mad, but he
sits down like a good little bitch.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Now, let's start torturing people, shall
           we? We'll start with...
               (Looks at Cartman)
           THIS little fat kid first!!

                     CARTMAN
           AY!  Don't call me fat, buttfucker-

ZAP!!  A huge CHARGE shoots from Cartman, knocking one of
hell's demons on his ass.

                     STAN
           Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!

                     CARTMAN
           How the fuck should I know!!

ZAP!!! Another huge CHARGE emits from the v-chip inside
Cartman and sends the other Swedish Soldier reeling.

                     KYLE
           Look at that!

                     CHEF
           It's that v-chip thing that's inside you,
           Eric!  The polarity must have been
           reversed by the electric chair!

                     TERRANCE
           Oh boy!

A smile comes across Cartman's face.

                     CARTMAN
           BUTTFUCKING SHIT!

BZZZZZZZZT!   A huge charge busts the chains that hold
Cartman's wrists.

He jumps down.

                     CARTMAN
           Yes!

TRIUMPHANT MUSIC plays as Cartman uses his newly found power.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Quick, Satan!  Do something!

But before Satan can do anything, Cartman holds up his hands
and lets loose.

                     CARTMAN
           FUCK A HUNK A SHIT, YOU RAT FUCK!!!

BZZZZZZZZZAAT!!!!  A charge hits Satan square between the
eyes and knocks him down.

He gets to his knees and stands up again.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Hey, you need to watch your mouth, brat!

                     CARTMAN
           Try this on for size-

Cartman holds up his hands.

                     CARTMAN
           DRIPPING VAGINA EATING SON OF A
           PIGFUCKING CRACK WHORE!!! HAIRY COCK
           SLURPING MAGGOT FUUUUUCK!!!!

BZZZAAAAT!!

The charge hits Saddam in the chest.  He drops again.

Saddam looks around and is suddenly scared.  He appeals to
Cartman.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Hey buddy!  No need to stress! Let me
           make you a deal!  How about a lifetime
           supply of Snacky Smores and we just
           forget about this whole thing?!

                     KYLE
           Don't listen to him, Cartman!

                     KENNY
           Mrphmmmph!!!

                     CARTMAN
           (giving in)  Okay.  (then)  Not.

Cartman closes his eyes and hums like he's summoning up the
worst words in the world.

Then, it comes out.  Like a volcano.

                     CARTMAN
           SUCK THE HOT SHIT FROM MY GURGLING ASS
           YOU BLOOD DRENCHED FROZEN TAMPON ON A
           STIIIIIIIIIIICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZATTTTTTTTT!!!!!

A huge purple jolt emerges from each of Cartman's hands and
joins into one powerful current that hits Saddam.  Saddam is
thrown back against the wall.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
               (To Satan)
           What are you waiting for, bitch?! Destroy
           him!!

Satan looks at Cartman, then at Saddam, and thinks...

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Come on you weak, stupid cum bucket! Save
           me!!

Satan stands there.

                     SATAN
           Help you? You've destroyed my life and
           now you want me to help you?!  You're
           always making me feel like a piece of
           shit.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Come on guy, you know I only rib you
           because I love you so much!

                     SATAN
           If you love somebody then you treat them
           with respect!  You've never respected me!

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Can we talk about this later?  Everyone
           is watching!

                     SATAN
           I don't care!  I want to talk about it
           now!

Saddam grabs Satan by the arm.

                     SATAN
           Ow, you're hurting me!

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Listen guy, you're embarassing me in
           front of my friends!  You know how I get
           mad when I get embarassed.

Satan starts getting really mad.  Steam starts coming from
his nostrils.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Your little problems can wait til later,
           see?

Steam starts coming out of Satan's nostrils.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           Now do what I say and keep your fucking
           mouth shut!

                     SATAN
           THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!

Satan picks up Saddam, and throws him over a huge, flaming
cliff, back into the depths of hell.

                     SADDAM HUSSEIN
           NOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooo!!!!! Heeeeyyyy
           guyyyyy, relaaaaaxx.....

                     CHEF
           Saddam Hussein is dead!

                     STAN AND KYLE
           Hooray!!!

Everyone cheers.

                     PHILLIP
           You're quite a purveyor of filth, little
           boy!

                     TERRANCE
           Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of
           words!

                     CARTMAN
           Well, I learned it all from you guys.

                     PHILLIP
           Of course you did, cock fuck!

They all laugh merrily.

Satan stands over the cliff, looking down at where Saddam
fell.

                     SATAN
           He spent so much time convincing me I was
           weak and stupid that I believed it
           myself.

The boys look at each other, confused.

                     SATAN
           Saddam didn't respect me.  All he wanted
           was sex.  But it took me so long to
           figure that out.

He starts to cry.  Chef hands him a hanky.

                     CHEF
           Here you go Satan-

                     SATAN
           Thank you. Give me the proofs of
           purchases.

Kenny hands them to Satan.

                     SATAN
           Okay Kenny, I will keep the bargain. Any
           wish you want is yours.

TRACK IN slowly on Kenny. MUSIC BUILDS. Finally, Kenny
speaks.

                     KENNY
           Mph rmph rmpg rmph mm.

Everyone GASPS!!

                     KYLE
           WHAT?

                     STAN
           Are you sure, Kenny?

                     SATAN
           What did he say?

                     STAN
           He said that his wish is for everyone who
           died in the war to come back.

                     CHEF
           Kenny, you realize this wish is the only
           chance for YOU not to be dead...

                     KENNY
           M mprh. Mph rmph rm rmph rm rmphm rmphm.
           Mm rmphm rmphm rhmphm.

Triumphant music plays, as if Kenny is giving a grand,
important speech.

                     SATAN
           Very well, then. I will put an end to the
           war as your wish and make everything as
           it was before the war started. But you
           Kenny, must remain dead.

                     KENNY
           Mph rm.

Satan turns to the open abyss.

                     SATAN
           I must admit, I'm kind of relieved. It's
           too fucking cold up here.

           Aren't there cold parts of hell?

                     SATAN
           Yeah, but it's a real dry cold. Here it's
           the humidity that gets me. I guess I'm
           destined to live in hell... alone...

Sadly, Satan walks back down the trench into hell. But
something catches his eye.

                     SATAN
           Hello... What's this?

Satan bends down and picks up Mr. Hat. He looks at it, and
then places it gently on his hand.

                     SATAN
           Hi there, little guy... Would you like to
           go to hell with me?

                     SATAN (AS MR. HAT)
           Sure. I bet we can be best friends!

Satan smiles. And walks down to hell with Mr. Hat.

The boys walks over to Kenny.

                     KYLE
           Thank you, Kenny.

                     STAN
           Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for
           us. You're a real pal.

A bright red light flashes and Satan and his minions are
dragged back down into hell. Kenny is taken along with them.

At the same time, Garrison, Jimbo, Mackey and all the others
who died, suddenly and magically appear. They look at
themselves, wondering what just happened.

Everyone just stands around in a daze. Canadians and
Americans alike look at each other and wonder what to do.

                     MR. GARRISON
           I... I'm alive... Where's Mr. Hat?

                     BIG GAY AL
           Wow... We were all killed and now we're
           fine. That's super!

                     KYLE
           Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.

                     STAN
           Yeah, but you know, I learned something
           today.  I learned that getting all worked
           up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is
           just stupid... You all focused so hard on
           erasing profanity that you forgot the
           most important thing... To love each
           other.

                     CARTMAN
           Yeah! You're all a bunch of stupid sons a
           bitches!

The boys' parents walk up.

                     STAN
           Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going
           to have fun with profanity just like you
           and dad did when you were little.

                     KYLE
           Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or
           dicksucker or, or-

                     KYLE'S MOTHER
           Shiteater-

                     STAN'S MOTHER
           -Or monkey fucker-

They all laugh merrily at their naughtiness.

Wendy walks up to Stan.

                     WENDY
           I'm sorry Stan, I guess you really DO get
           it after all!

Stan smiles. MUSIC swells.

                     STAN
           Wendy... How would you like to go get
           some ice cream?

                     WENDY
           Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice
           cream?

                     STAN
           My friend the clitoris told me.

                     WENDY
           Wow, I have a clitoris too.

                     STAN
           Really? Where the hell do you keep it?
           It's huge.

Wendy grabs Stan and plants a big kiss on him. Stan vomits
into Wendy's mouth.

                     STAN
           But Wendy... What about Gregory?

Gregory stands off to one side, scowling.

                     WENDY
           Stan, I never cared for Gregory.

                     STAN
           You didn't?

                     WENDY
           No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.

                     STAN
           Cool!

                     WENDY
               (Singing)
           Thank my lucky stars
           Here before me now
           Is everything I'd ever hoped for-

                     STAN
           Knew it in a word
           Saw it in a glance
           The only thing I think I'd die for

                     STAN AND WENDY
           I can't stop now... My heart's
           awake!
           I pray your arms my arms to take!
           So this is why I'm alive!

Now everyone joins hands and starts singing-

                     EVERYONE
           SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE, UNCLEFUCKA!
           YOU'RE A COCK SUCKING ASS RAPING
           UNCLEFUCKA!
           YOU'RE AN UNCLEFUCKA, YES IT'S
           TRUE!
           NOBODY FUCKS UNCLES QUITE LIKE YOU!
           UNCLEFUCKAAA!!!

Kenny's mom and dad come up.

                     KENNY'S DAD
           This is all so wonderful.  I just wish
           our little Kenny could see all of this
           joy.

                     KYLE
           Oh he can, dude.  Look!

Kyle points to the sky.  Everyone looks up just in time to
see a brilliant shooting star across the daytime sky.

We follow the shooting star and then slowly ZOOM in on it.
As we get closer, we realize it is actually Kenny, shooting
towards the heavens.

As TRIUMPHANT MUSIC plays, Kenny's little body floats up and
up through the clouds. (NOTE:  This will also be done in 3-D
CGI)

Rays of light from above bathe his body and he flies up into
the warmth of the baby blueness.

Angels encircle him and give him a pair of wings.  They smile
gently.  He feels calm.  He feels good.

Amidst a group of angels, Kenny flies upwards and finally...
into Heaven.
